"I've never started watching him until I've heard of his death. I've seen him in some clips before, so I decided to watch 1 or 2 of his videos to see what he's about. About 20 videos later, I really started to like him, and then started getting excited for his next post, until it dawned on me....
I'd never been able to have a connection with him when he was alive. As I teared up, I watched more and more of his videos, knowing that I couldn't ever meet him or see him again. He became one of my heroes, one of them, the big ones. This was one hero I knew I would never be like, but I told myself, ""You need to carry on his legacy, you've wanted to be like him ever since like 2 weeks ago when you started watching. You can't let him down."" Now, if only I was born a few years earlier, like say, 2005, I'd meet him, I'd see his videos earlier, I could call myself a FAN. I feel like I do not deserve this title, as a just started watching him, but fast forward 2 years, and I've almost seen all of his videos. How funny he was, chill, and happy. The reason I stopped watching him, is because I know one day, I'll run out of videos to watch, I did not want that day to come, EVER. 




For techno- Fly high technoblade, even though I was not your fan 3 years ago, I am now, and I love your videos. Your one of the best. I would love to be honored enough to use your famous catchphrase online, ""technoblade never dies,"" but I do not think I deserve it because I haven't been your fan for long enough. If not me, then hand it to someone like tommyinnit. And with that, technoblade. Never. Dies.

"Have been revisiting Technoblade's videos, and I kept getting a feeling thet he was a real-life version of a character archetype, but I couldn't place my finger on it. Watching this...
Technoblade bears a striking resemblance to characters like Kamina (elder brother from Gurren Lagann), Ace/Shanks from One piece, or Kakkashi from Naruto. He's a leader who brought joy/safety/security to those around him. Through his actions he raised others up, made their lives better, inspired them. Now that he is gone... we all feel the pain, but he's left behind a path for the next generation.

Cant think about Im an not cry

Lost to go fight god
And I bet he won
Death only made him stronger
Every story shows greatness
Never will we recover
Even in the darkest of times
Very funny, made us laugh
Everlasting in our memories
Ready for another day now
Dont see him on twitch now
I see him in chyanne 
Even though its been a year
Sadly the pain is still here...

Don't wanna live as an untold story
Rather go out in a blaze of glory
I can't hear you, I don't fear you
I live now cause the Bad die last
Dodging bullets with your broken past
I can't hear you, I don't fear you now
Wrapped in your regret
What a waste of blood and sweat
Oh oh oh
I wanna taste love and pain
Wanna feel pride and shame
I don't wanna take my time
Don't wanna waste one life
I wanna live better days
Never look back and say
It could've been me, it could've been me, yeah

Don't wanna live as an unsung melody
I'd rather listen to the silence telling me
I can't hear you, I won't fear you
Don't wanna wake up on a monday morning
The thought of work is getting my skin crawling
I can't fear you, I don't hear you now
Wrapped in your regret
What a waste of blood and sweat
Oh oh oh
I wanna taste love and pain
Wanna feel pride and shame
I don't wanna take my time
Don't wanna waste on line
I wanna live better days

"I‚Äôm a massive fan of Techno, never subscribed because I only got a YT account recently and I can‚Äôt bring myself to look at his channel, one of the reasons I found who I was was because of his involvement in the Minecraft community.

It‚Äôs difficult, I‚Äôm probably gonna die a similar way to him because of my genetics, I hope a cure to cancer is made by then, I don‚Äôt wanna lose anyone, from content creators I never knew to my own family.

I always use one of his quotes pretty much every time I need to comfort someone because it comforts me so much.
‚ÄúEverything is within my calculations.‚Äù Is the quote.

I normally favour characters I relate to but Techno‚Äôs DSMP character is gonna be my all time favourite character ever, no matter the communities I‚Äôm in his creations will always be my favourite even though I only relate to the anxiety peer pressure things.

I feel shame over the fact I can‚Äôt bring myself to interact with his content besides stuff related to his character, I hope everything will be okay in the end.

I believe in ghosts and all that paranormal sh*t so one part of me feels comfort knowing that if ghost are real he‚Äôd probably be chilling just watching everyone, laughing at people, just chilling. He seems like the ghost who would do harmless things to mess with people investigating, just doing the randomest things to scare ghost hunters.

Techno is a great person.

"The world is crashing down
But you won‚Äôt see me cry
You won‚Äôt see me die
For you
For you
 I‚Äôm still holding on for you 
And everyone
Because when I close my eyes all I see is you faces 
Willing me on
And I‚Äôm still holding on
With everything I‚Äôve got cause you won‚Äôt se me fall
For you
And how am I supposed to live 
Why isn‚Äôt the world dead with despair
How are people okay
With knowing one of them is gone
But you won‚Äôt see me complain
I will stay strong
I will move on 
To save you
All I do is for you
For you for you
And with everything that‚Äôs happened 
I didn‚Äôt cry
I didn‚Äôt break
I didn‚Äôt fall down 
And it‚Äôs all for you
Because when your at your lowest
I bring you to the top
And when your done trying to hold 
I will do everything 
For you
For you
For you
Because your pain is mine
(My pain is yours)
Your tears are mine 
(My tears are yours)
Your guilt is mine
(My guilt is yours)
You feel for the both of us
One of us needs, to be strong, to hold on, to everything left, to will you on, when you can‚Äôt hold on
And do it all for you
For you
And when your done,
When you move on, 
When you het up,
And re-write the wrong,
When your are done,
With your sad little song, 
That‚Äôs when I will sing along 
For me
For me
For me
And when I move on,
This‚Äôll all be gone
But in our hearts he will remain
In our heart lies technoblade

I've never even heard this song before but I immediately realized how perfect it was to tell Technoblade's story. Stories of ambition and success, triumphing against all the odds and lamenting all you've lost to get there, but still celebrating the journey, they always leave me choked up. I've always had the utmost respect for people who are willing to give their all to being great, who won't back down, and Techno truly lived his life to the fullest, even if it was cut short. _Especially_ because it was cut short. 
But even with that sorrow, he made so many friends with people along the way, and he changed the lives of so, so many more, and you showed that perfectly during the chorus part, with the scene of everyone putting on the pins. We all love you Alex. Technoblade never dies.

"This means a lot to me genuinely. A few years back I lost my grandpa due to cancer. It triggered my depression and much more severe stuff I'm not willing to get into at the moment. During that time my father distanced himself because I became a "" difficult child "". I watched techno Dailey even if he didn't upload. I was so sad everyday and would never smile, laugh and barley had any energy, but when I heard him screaming "" hippity hoppity get off my property "" I would laugh my ass off. And honestly I still do. Hearing about his passing to the same thing that killed my closest family member was tragic. But even if he's gone he has still found so many ways to support and help us through it. He was and is and will always be loved like he always loved us.

"I don't even know what to say, thank you for making this. I personally only just started watching Techno a few months before he got cancer, and then shortly after that, he died. I wish I had watched him throughout all my childhood, but now it's too late. I love the thought and effort put into this, it feels like we lost so much in 2020 through 2022, and now we lost one of the biggest legends ever to grace our planet. Losing Techno, we should be more appreciative of the people we have now, as we never know when we might lose them, or ourselves. We must hold onto the things we have now, while they're still here with us, before they are gone, before they leave us never to come back to us again. Even though nothing will replace Techno, we should open ourselves up to others in hope new legends are made, so future generations can have a sort of techno of their own, someone they can look up to, someone who will fill them with strength.

I remember the night the video was posted. I was chilling in my room and suddenly ""Techno upload!""
I got super excited, clicked and was surprised with the start to say the least. When his father started reading his last message, I just thought it was fake for a while. I couldn't believe it was real.
The video ended, and I was confused, I called my mom and told her that a youtuber I liked had died (just to make things clear: english isn't my first language so I never talk to my parents about english youtubers). She gave me a hug, and that was it. I kinda went on with the night 
The day after, I remember that at some point it finally hit me. He was  gone. Really gone.
I spent nearly the next 3 hours crying, and everytime I think about this I cry again and again. It's been a year now, and I still can't get over it. He was my idol, a friend that I never met. It was my dream to in some fan tour talk to him or something, but oh well...

I miss him. We all do. But he will never be dead, his memory must shine forever :)

"Ok, idk why but of all things I'm choking up over the fact this tribute has nearly 1 million views. I hope Technoblade's legacy continues to be remembered and celebrated with amazing contributions like this from the community. We knew him as a YouTuber, but he was an entire person with hopes and dreams and a whole life behind and ahead of him, like all of us. And like so many others, he fought cancer while trying to make the best of it.

It's weird, I watched his videos often as a kid but drifted away as I lost interest in Minecraft. I never appreciated the fact he wouldn't be around forever. He was like one of those distant relatives you get a quick update from xD I'd watch a video or two every few months, where I'd feel a quiet happiness at his growing success and move on. I didn't appreciate how short of a life someone can live while still making an invaluable impact. I know if he had lived longer, his memory would be just as incredible. And I guess that's all we can hope for in the end.

I'm sorry and wishing the best to anyone's who's lost a loved one, but to cancer especially. One day we'll rise above it.

"Technoblade is the only Youtuber/content creator that has passed or moved on that I think about on a weekly basis. I've been a fan of his since his early skywars days, but really only started to watch him around when Minecraft Monday started.

I hadn't properly understood how people could get so attached and feel such emotion at the lost of someone that they never met before Techno. I was a fan of a lot of bands and actors, and felt sad when they died. But I broke out in tears the night after as it sat in. I don't think I'll ever stop thinking about him and what could've been. I'm a very antisocial person and hate attention, but I think I'd gladly shout my fondness in front of millions. 

All this to say, Technoblade never dies, and won't if we carry him. Keep watching old videos, keep making comments, keep making beautiful art and videos like this one, and most of all hold him in our memories as we grow old and join him in whatever afterlife exists if any.",@HeroAkii,UgyABnZlfu5f7d0a2ch4AaABAg,0

Could Have Been Me


[Verse 1]
Don't wanna live as an untold story
Rather go out in a blaze of glory
I can't hear you, I don't fear you
I'll live now 'cause the bad die last
Dodging bullets with your broken past
I can't hear you, I don't fear you now

[Refrain]
Wrapped in your regret
What a waste of blood and sweat
Oh oh oh

[Chorus]
I wanna taste love and pain
Wanna feel pride and shame
I don't wanna take my time
Don't wanna waste one line
I wanna live better days
Never look back and say
Could have been me
It could have been me
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Don't wanna live as an unsung melody
I'd rather listen to the silence telling me
I can't hear you, I won't fear you
Don't wanna wake up on a Monday morning
The thought of work is getting my skin crawling
I can't fear you, I don't hear you now

[Refrain]
Wrapped in your regret
What a waste of blood and sweat
Oh oh oh

[Chorus]
I wanna taste love and pain
Wanna feel pride and shame
I don't wanna take my time
Don't wanna waste one line
I wanna live better days
Never look back and say
Could have been me
It could have been me
Yeah

[Breakdown]
Hey
(I wanna taste love and pain
Wanna feel pride and shame
Don't wanna take my time)
No
(Don't wanna waste one line)
Hey, hey
(Wanna live better days)
Just better
(Never look back and say)
Could have been me
It could have been me
It could have been me
It could have been me

[Chorus]
I wanna taste love and pain
Wanna feel pride and shame
I don't wanna take my time
Don't wanna waste one line
I wanna live better days (Just better)
Never look back and say
Could have been me
It could have been me
It could have been me
It could have been me

Yeah
Hey

"Gods I miss him so much. I didn't even realise it had happened at first. It was like 11 pm and I had just gotten home from a hockey game and saw that Phil's server was locked for some reason and then saw all the o7s and Legends Never Die messages and i just knew.... I hoped I was wrong so I googled his name and saw that it said he was dead, but couldn't believe it so I went to his channel and started sobbing when I saw the title of the video. Honestly, I still haven't watched it. I read the transcript over and over but I can't bring myself to watch it.

"i haven't been able to get the words to word correctly to leave a comment until now (still can't tbh but i have to comment) but this is genuinely so incredible.
i love everything about this tribute you've made. i love that i know every reference. i love the vibe and the warm and fun feeling from the whole thing. 
but i especially love the song choice.

seeeeeveral years back i used to listen to this song on repeat (like, it could be an hour or more consecutively no joke) basically every day. it was my ""this is the song that gets me pumped and keeps me going"" song, especially during some really difficult times.
but within the past couple years i had some particularly hard things happen and i just sort of...forgot this song existed somehow??
when i watched this it was the first time i heard it in a long time. and it really hit hard (in a good way) especially associating it with Technoblade, who i also became familiar with during the time that things became particularly hard.

anyway, like i said, words are hard and i can't do words properly. but basically, i wanted to say that this tribute is incredible and it really just hit me hard in a good way because the song means so much to me and, of course, so does Technoblade for basically the same reasons. they've been motivations for me to sort of ""keep going"" and all that during especially low points in my life.
so now not only does this song have the ""pow!"" it already had because it was ""my motivation song"" anyway, but now it just has even more because i will now have it associated with this video and Technoblade and all the motivation i've felt from him.
this is beautiful. i love this.

so yeah i have literally been listening to the song on repeat for entire work days almost every day since watching your video, and i keep coming back to watch this whenever i get a chance.

this tribute is amazing. you're amazing. thank you for sharing your wonderful skill with the community/the world and also for accidentally reminding me of my Anime Motivation Song (tm) and making it even more powerful haha.

"Don't wanna live as an untold story
Rather go out in a blaze of glory
I can't hear you, I don't fear you
I'll live now 'cause the bad die last
Dodging bullets with your broken past
I can't hear you, I don't fear you now
Wrapped in your regret
What a waste of blood and sweat
Oh-oh-oh
I wanna taste love and pain
Wanna feel pride and shame
I don't wanna take my time
Don't wanna waste one line
I wanna live better days
Never look back and say
Could have been me
It could have been me
Yeah
Don't wanna live as an unsung melody
I'd rather listen to the silence telling me
I can't hear you, I won't fear you
Don't wanna wake up on a Monday morning
The thought of work is getting my skin crawling
I can't fear you, I don't hear you now
Wrapped in your regret

"I'm not one for parasocial relationships; I find the idea of worshiping someone because they're elevated in a community to be a dangerous practice, one that often leads to abuse.

I had watched his old skywars videos as an early teen, and I've watched him grow from a skywars youtuber to one of the most influential people in his community, even if it was digital. And none of it was inflated, or fake. He worked his ass off to get where he was. He leaped every hurdle placed before him, regularly astounding everyone watching. I'm an Adult now, and I really have to thank Technoblade for all that he's done. He had a large impact on my life. He may have died incredibly young; but when he lived, he burned brightest of them all.",@thumpted8417,Ugzid41B2cCvNkSrXjB4AaABAg,1

"‚ÄûI think Skyblock at its core is the ultimate challenge in resource management. You spawn on a tiny island in an empty universe. All you have is a tree, some supplies and some dirt to stand on. You have to treasure EVERY dirt block, because if one falls into the void, there's no way to replace it and as you carefully navigate your absurd circumstance, you gain a new appreciation for the few things you have as you meticulously use them to their fullest effect. With nothing but some ice, lava and saplings you slowly transform this empty expanse into a world of your very own. Skyblock teaches us that no matter how ridiculous the odds may seem, within us resides the power to overcome these challenges and achieve something beautiful. That one day, we'll look back at where we started and be amazed by how far we've come.‚Äú

i was so close to crying when i saw the purple ribbon appear on screen. i remember the first time he talked about having cancer. so many people came out to support him, so many people updated their mc skins with the ribbon to show their love. 
you had me properly sobbing at the next scene though. at first i thought it was just showing how he made people light up, but when i realized that it was about how much he inspired people, and still does, to create art for the world in his honor and memory. 

can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs already been a year. when i first saw the notification pop up on my phone, i was spending the night at a friends house.
i whole heartedly believed the video was a joke and he was still alive. i wanted to even after i watched the video

Hard to grief a death of someone you personally never met, there was no real contact but there's still that connection that is now left behind and we don't know how to reconnect.
The legacy that pig left behind will never begone, even in the distant future where he may be less remembered, the mention of Minecraft, of the people that shaped this community, he will always be there and we will always make sure the name Technoblade is never lost to time.

"Even after his death, you should all realize you could be as happy, as talented, as great as him.
It takes so much to find what we're really happy for, **I** found a vision of it, and God swept it right off me. It took a dream to realize reality.
Now that he, the legend, is gone, we will do our part to become legends of our own, however way we're gonna do it.

whether it would be standing beside the crown, standing beside the world, a talent that you'd find a one-hit wonder, anything.

it's gonna be a long time, but at least it's still during our time.
we'll win and lose no matter how great we are.
it's just the matter of strength to choose if we wanna stand when we fall.
technoblade has. a lot. and fate decided to take it then and there.

he's your inspiration, your, or mine. find something that is worth fighting for in your lives, even it looks and feels like an empty void in space, because it's not gonna be empty anymore, it'll be filled of your greatest and saddest times, your trophies and your terrors.

""You must be faithful of your past, grateful of your present to serve for your future.""
(i made the quote in a fit of passion on a school project.)

soon we'll see each other with crowns over our heads, titles we can show, and achievements we can talk about, i wish to become an animator, and one of a great level, because i have one hell of a vision, and it would be great if i know yours. technoblade did it, many others did, who says you can't? 

good fucking luck to y'all, soon I'll go back to see y'all.

"Personally I like to think techno laid down his crown, cape and sword happily ofc with  sadness as he leaves us. But glad he could make a change and knew that as he left. Something greater will happen.

Or he left to fight the gods who knows.

He never wanted us to weep for him, just to meme his death. And while I'm still sad and I know everyone else is too we must come to terms with this and accept that he's no longer here, as there is always something after everything even death when you leave this plane and go to another.

I want him to come back I really do, but he won't and I've accepted that. So while I will never get over it fully and neither will you. We can be certain of one thing for ever.

"God damn it doesn‚Äôt even feel real that he‚Äôs gone. I know it‚Äôs been a year and I really should have been able to except his death and move on by now but it‚Äôs still so hard. Technoblade was such a large part of my childhood, it‚Äôs just so weird to think he‚Äôll never be as large a part of future generations‚Äô childhoods as he was for me. I remember when I first got recommended Techno‚Äôs channel. It was just before Minecraft Monday, and I thought, What the heck is this crappy thumbnail all about? It was the dumbest thing ever but it made me laugh so much I couldn‚Äôt not click on the video. I remember just chilling on Techno‚Äôs Minecraft Monday steams watching him kill people but talking about other random stuff, chat jokingly mocking him when he messed up after doing really well. I remember laughing as I would later watch others act so terrified of Techno when they saw him even though I knew he and chat were just chilling over at his stream. I remember the long waits for new Technoblade content and the excitement I‚Äôd feel when I got a notification of a new video from him. I remember how excited I was when I heard he was gonna be in MCC after Minecraft Monday ended and a strange nostalgic feeling when I saw him go live again for MCC. I remember going home after school just to rewatch his videos since I knew I‚Äôd never get bored of them no matter how many times I watched them. I remember panicking every time I was in school and saw him go live because I wanted to catch the stream but also had work to do. I have so many other memories of him, and I know I never knew him personally, only through the screen, but he did so much for my childhood and I will forever be grateful for that. The reason we say Technoblade never dies is not just because it‚Äôs hard to kill him in Minecraft, but because even when he has passed, he will still forever live on in the hearts and minds of everyone who knew and watched him. Technoblade never dies because we won‚Äôt let him be forgotten. So thank you Technoblade, though you‚Äôll never read this, thank you for all you‚Äôve done for me.

"What an interesting phenomenon it is. For one human to have made such an impact in so many lives. To have made such an impact that even a year later millions still oath to never forget? Its is a beautiful sight. Through the worst moments in my life this past year, and through all the instances I had felt the want to give up? Whether it be it be in my dreams, in friendships, and even life? I would sit back and realise how lucky I was to have discovered this community. I started YouTube because of Technoblade and a few other of my idols and even though I have dreams that a so far from realistic, hell I play a sport in which I want to succeed where .000000365 percent of people make it professional and out of that number only 20% even make a living! I have never given up. And as much as it sounds clich√© if I take anything out of this loss of an amazing person who deserved every bit of fame he had and still has, is that everything could be gone in an instant, and even the great and kind shall one day be caught by death itself. So as Technoblade himself once said ‚ÄòNo matter how ridiculous the odds may seem, within us resides the power to overcome these challenges and achieve something beautiful‚Äô. So hey, one day I may have achieved something I have set out to do. But until then I‚Äôm going to be grateful for every little moment. Because life is one amazing mess of anguish and joy. At the end of the day as much as life is beautiful, the price we pay for living is that one day you simply won‚Äôt and if that isn‚Äôt a reason grateful for the now then I don‚Äôt know what is.

Technoblade will forever inspire me to chase my dreams and to find sunshine even in the worst of times, so if anyone‚Äôs still reading, I want you to remember one thing.
I‚Äôm rooting for you, go do something great, and always remember

Technoblade Never Dies.

But when he announced he had Cancer and yet still uploaded the same quality content, It truly inspired me and others as well, He inspired me to try youtube, i remember scrolling down his channel and going back to the very first video he ever uploaded, He sounded so much younger back then, I couldn't help but feel my heart getting heavy whenever i saw a picture of technoblade or heard his voice again.

I hope he‚Äôs resting well and can smile on what he achieved in such a short amount of time. I can only imagine how influential he was to his younger fans. To anyone that is younger reading this. Go take his advice and go do what you love, or find it if you haven‚Äôt already.

he was gone way too soon, and it hurts knowing he could have lived for so much longer and faded into obscurity with an early retirement. it hits me so hard because my name is also alex and my family has a strong history of cancers. right now, i'm going through some breast cancer screenings because of some weirdness in my left breast. seeing him as he was‚Äîas he IS‚Äîis so beautiful and such a comfort

"""Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.

"The fact not only i cried because of our loss, but because everything at the begining was so, so happy i even forgot he was dead. Then, the crown started to apear in the screen, i slowly realized how wrong i was. By the time Techno was leaving his sword, crown and cape i noticed i was crying bcs of his death. 
I know its hard to understand what im trying to say. To put it short; At the begining, i was thinking abt how cool those event were and when the following ones will be. About how exited i was for a new upload, but reality slaped me whit the hard, raw truth. There will be no new Technoblade moments, jokes, videos, streams, laughs or even clips of him. He is dead, and that's it.
Look, I'm an Atheist, but if there is a heaven or at least something remotly close; i want him there. Happy and in peace.

Rest in power, Technoblade. You deserve that and more.

"Initially, I didn't care much for the smp group; their content seemed geared towards young teenagers, and as a result, it failed to appeal to me. However, with the tragic news of Technoblade's untimely passing, I discovered a renewed appreciation for this community. It is remarkable how one individual could inspire so much passion and loyalty among people from all walks of life, regardless of age or background.

Technoblade's impact on this community was of monumental proportions. His contributions helped to keep this community alive and thriving, and his presence will sorely be missed. It is comforting to know that his family can take solace in the fact that he made such a lasting impact on so many people's lives.

I would like to express my gratitude to the person who created this video tribute. It is a beautiful reminder of the positive influence Technoblade had on this community. His legacy will continue to inspire others for many years to come.",@seekerandroses,UgxPa4Ha-PStsfEiCKx4AaABAg,0

"First of all, this tribute is one of the most fitting ones on Youtube, and made my cry all over again.

I know I can't add anything original, but I would like to add a quote that was used for the remembrance of Charles M. Schulz on his 100th birthday, postmortem. It was painted in fireworks in a night sky in a comic called Wizard of Id. 

Anyway, the quote is:
""Heroes are always remembered, and legends never die.""

I know it's close to the catchphrase we all use, but I figured it applied just as much as any saying. Many great men have passed, whether they turn into heroes or legends, depends on how we carry on their name.

We'll always carry on the name of the Blade.

Godspeed, Techno.",@rufusisaac9936,Ugwia_NG5ey0lpzDvtR4AaABAg,2

Literally, he may not be with us, but we still have techno-logy. Just like AI was trained to mimic voices of other people, it can be trained to mimic Techno's talking so we can continue to make content in his memory. There's a reason he made so much content for us and we should respect his skills, goals, wishes and attempt to make the world more aware of the dangers of reality. He may seem not so serious or a meme person, but honestly you won't find many people who would do what he did, to create a goal and live it, knowing that it's against the odds.

His voice broke me. If I had the choice I would have died so that he could have continued living. I remember calling my friends over a man I didn't know. We stayed on call for hours, just crying, I didn't even leave my room for meals. I refused to eat. It took a big chunk out of my mental health when he passes.
My friend stumbled into somebody the day after his death. They had made their own technoblade mask. It was very detailed. She kept looking and sent my a picture. She never noticed but they had changed the eye colour to a blury grey, and gotten rid of the pupil that they used to put in it.

"i lived in a different timezone as him, so when he streams i would wake up between 3 am and 4 am just to watch him secretly from my parents. it was hard to contain my laughs when he cracks a joke or make a deadpanned statement that hes known for. it became like a routine to me. some times when im feeling sad or when im doing something, i would pull up one of his videos and just let it play in the background. i dont know, his voice juat keeps me in high spirits all the time.

this made me cry so much and made me realized that i was there when he was making history, we were there with him, albeit in his highs or lows we stood beside him.

Though I wish i could meet him in person, i am still happy i knew *of* and knew him through  the many videos he made, and memories he shared to us, the community.

I could've forgotten about his channel and never knew about his death. I could've never watched his videos. I could've ignored his existence. Yet, I stayed. I came back, and had a great time watching his videos. Especially when he outsmarted skeppy that one time. Those ones were honestly hilarious. We always stayed, never thinking about the end. Yet here we are...

Or is it? 

Even though he's gone, he will always remain in our hearts.

I sincerely hope that those who knew and loved Techno sees the love that the community, that the world has for Techno and feel comfort in knowing that their loved one hasn't been forgotten by everyone.

He was the first youtuber that I knew and watched that passed away, and I assume that's the same for many other people. And with TinFoilChef dying, another minecraft youtuber, apart of HermitCraft, I always watched him, so with two amazing minecraft youtubers dying only two months apart, it really made me sad.

Every step he took was large and thunderous, and it's amazing that he's hit 16 million subs after his passing. 6 million people saw the video announcing Techno's death, and subscribed for one reason or another.

"My god, I teared up a little. Fuck, this has my heart.

It strikes me now that even though he was a man behind a screen, a man behind a piggy mask, he reached our hearts beyond how real life people could.

You could bond with people all because you were apart of his community.

So many people survived depression because of him. So many people saw him as a comfort streamer. They saw comfort where they couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere else, not even from their alive parents. He reached our hearts when he wasn‚Äôt even here with us. It just shows how much the world needed him.

Many people say how they‚Äôre thankful that not everyone has forgotten him. The thing is, no one will ever forget. Even if you hated him, even if you never watched him, many people know that he was a legend, defying Minecraft‚Äôs supposed way of playing when he played with a wheel, or winning a whole potato war just for the fun of it. He pvp‚Äôed like no other, making hundreds, thousands, even millions smile all at once.

Technoblade lives on, in our hearts, minds, and spirits.

Technoblade will not die as long as the community keeps him alive.

"yaknow, techno affected us all. from the people who were religous fans to the ones who had just found him, and thought he was funny, thought he was someone worth subscribing to. he affected me in a way that i never thought he could, and when i saw him pass away, even if he didnt know me or i didnt know him, even just someone as insignificant as a youtuber i enjoyed watching died, i started to treasure what i had lost. the life we lost that day was more than just a life. it was a legacy, a story told of someone who changed the lives of so many people. and while you may say thats sort of weird that he changed people making commentary videos beating of 9 year olds on the internet playing a block game, and while some people may believe you, i and many others would dissagree. him making the videos on the potato wars, minecraft monday, bullying james charles in minecraft. all of this funny nonesesical crap that his videos were had something more than your average youtuber could ever produce in a video. the feeling of family. techno will always be someone who i could sit next to and just chill with. someone that i could love as a friend. the people you impact even to this day, the fights you fought, whether it was beating ImASquidKid or trying to beat cancer. i just want to thank you for being a big part of my and so many other peoples lives. you will always be a part of history within the community of youtube and online media. we owe so much to you. im sure god doesnt care if your a aetheist, but because you were the best person you could have been, thats what really matters. that you help others, and you sure did that god damn well.",@mewosocs,UgzhKq5l4fqTLsdSbp54AaABAg,0

I've seen change among the people who seen his videos and after just one week of watching his videos, my sister told me to watch his new video that was called ""so long nerds. "" and after watching g it I cried so hard like apart of me we're gone, I was so confused and stressed as I thought, could he really be dead? Will he come back to tell us it's a joke?

I may not have known him personally, but I feel better having known I was subscribed to him and I was able to join in the chants of 'E' and 'One of Us' especially the well-known 'BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD' which I will continue to say because- Blood for the blood god... I hope he's watched this from heaven because it is one of the finer masterpieces I've watched!

i hate to say it, i didnt like him at first cause he was so intimidating, but after my friend [thank you Wolfie.] introducing me to him, i found that he was actually very funny, i laughed at his jokes, i laughed at interactions he made with quackity and the others

ill never forget the impact he made in this platform, uniting minecrafters again after it'd died down, of course with the help of wilbur, philza, quackity, [dream and the hunters cough], bbh, skeppy, and all the other people who made stories in minecraft again.

it took me back to the time i watched Aphmau skits, wondering how did they do that.. how does this pink neko girl have moving ears and tails but it looks so out of place, and the modded adventures she had back when she hasnt hired anyone yet and was doing it with npcs


im very happy with how far the mc community has come, and all the people who introduced it to the newer generations, even with a deteriorating platform [both yt and mc] they still made the most out of it

and so did Techno or Alex as his name is.

He influenced me so much in my life and I honestly don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd be right now if it wasn‚Äôt for him.

Techno was such an inspiration for me, he made me find what I actually like, and I‚Äôve even picked up phrases or habits of his. It‚Äôs sad that many of us never got to thank him for the big impact he made in millions of peoples lives, but I hope that he already realized it.

Techno will forever be missed, and will never be forgotten thanks to the community and the amazing artists and animators that have kept his memory alive. Hopefully it stays that way.

Edit (June 30th): A bit over a week ago I was in the car, listening to music with my dad when this song play. As the song started, I said, ‚Äúsomeone made a tribute to Technoblade with this song.‚Äù
The rest of the song played and he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying.‚Äù

I just finished watching Tommy‚Äôs tribute, and I won‚Äôt lie by saying I didn‚Äôt cry a little. I only started watching Techno‚Äôs videos in late February/early March, and at the time my family was dealing with a lot and due to that I had a lot of alone time. I binge watched Techno‚Äôs streams and videos, and it made feel less lonely.

A man isn‚Äôt dead until he‚Äôs forgotten, and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll be forgotten any time soon.

"He inspired millions of people just because he has him.
He was and still is a legend among us. Tho still just a human.
Alex may have passed away but with this move he also won cancer too.
Technoblade never dies. remember that... he will always be in our hearts and memories.

Guys
 he went to fight God for us and i am sure he won.!
i am sure that if god sended him to hell he hestitated and took him back to heaven


like he said if he had another 100 lives he would choose to be technoblade all over again and again

Him dying is a win for him but not for cancer
because he won cancer too. 
i am happy and glad to know him and his wonderfool work.
 
everyone starts from 0, from nothing and with slow pace will get the 100%
if u rush to go to 100% when u are in 20% u will fail
its ok to fall and fail because this way u learn even better. u will get up again and u will continue. u will become a better person, a better human. 

u can be the next techno, the next dream the next anyone u want, but with your character, u will form ur own community from nothing, not many will know you at the start, but once you finally to start making bigger things more people will  come to see you and your work. people will like to watch you because u are being an influence to the with your personality <3

that's all i wanted to say 

peace out

He helped me alot when i knew him, dark times were a little lighter whenever we'd catch the classic ""startiinn the stream"".

"Technoblade was the best role model I have ever seen on the internet, by a long shot. There's two sides to each coin, and he consistently showed nothing but the merits of both sides, if that analogy makes any sense. Several other youtubers are good role models, but Technoblade was the most unique and subtle by a long shot. Few people can be humble, kind, wise, laid back souls and ""the second worst thing to ever happen to those orphans"" at the same time. He was able to teach moral lessons and strategic wisdom to millions without stopping the video and making it a lecture. In fact, he even reversed it - he enhanced the quality of his videos by applying them to masterful effect in the most bizarre and pointless scenarios. This meant he didn't have to water down his online persona at all - he got to be both an exceptional role model and much more than the hundredth worst thing to ever happen to those orphans. Of course, this meant viewers that didn't see the bigger picture behind his ambitious, dramatic, competitive, and egotistical facade wouldn't realize how impressively virtuous he was. However, that didn't stop them from secretly, subconsciously learning from Technoblade.

I once heard of ""the Techno Effect,"" where Techno apparently made those around him more aggressive. At first, I agreed with it, but in retrospect it was completely untrue. If that were the case, why was his fanbase so unwaveringly patient with his upload schedule? Why was half of his screen time flooded with laughter, from both the video and the viewers, and none of it resentment? Instead, I'd like to propose a different ""Techno Effect:"" instead of rousing aggression in his peers, Technoblade inspired constructive, creative passion in them by convincing them of fun in things. Where most role model types merely speak about how being a good person can be good for you, Technoblade demonstrated live what a wildly, exhilaratingly fun time it could be. Where most people would see challenges in video games as tests of willpower and problem solving to complete and trophies to collect, Technoblade slowly became the backbone of the Minecraft community by using his indomitable will and steering wheel to bring the community together in a massive network of *friends.* Not competitors, not just colleagues or peers, but genuine *friends* who cared about each other and still care about each other because Technoblade helped bring them together. Whether his peers came together to stop him from bulldozing through competitions, or his fans came together in patient anticipation for his next upload, or his fellow youtubers came together in the aforementioned network he spent half of his life building from scratch, he brought everyone together to stay, and continue making memories together, in his absence and his memory. Many of Minecraft's most successful videos are collabs between groups of people, and while there were many pioneers of this, Technoblade was arguably the greatest one.

I would only realize any of this after watching Skeppy's video talking about Technoblade's death and the life he lived. When dealing with Youtubers, their actions outside of the camera speak the loudest about their personality, and in Skeppy's video, he revealed plainly who Technoblade truly was underneath his crown. He didn't choose his PvP teams based on skill or clout - he was just there to make friends. He eclipsed everyone else in Skywars and Bedwars, but he wasn't trying to be the best - he just happened to be and made the most of it. He was just there to have a good time, and I cannot even imagine how important that was to him if not even his own death could get in the way of that.

The last two Minecraft videos he would ever make stand out immensely to me for that reason. His cancer was getting worse, and doubt had to have started creeping into him and his loved ones at that point. And yet, he chose to spend his last two videos not on rounding out a bucket list of difficult, radical, and almost meaningless Minecraft feats, or even to update his fans on his condition in a less depressing way. In fact, he wasn't even like that in his update videos, but that's going off track. In his last two Minecraft videos, ""Destroying Friendships with the Minecraft Gravity Mod"" and ""The Minecraft VR Experience,"" he wasn't trying to accomplish anything unreasonably hard or impressive. He just wanted to sit back and goof around with the game he had spent so long being such an integral part of, and the friends he had already spent so long enjoying it with.

And for such a laid back person, he was so incredibly inspiring. Whether he was farming potatoes for unhealthy amounts of time, dominating thousands of Skywars games in a row, or going on oddly philosophical rants in the middle of mowing through legions of players in Bedwars, he was inspiring everyone to shoot for the moon while staying laid back. There was always an air of humbleness and patience beneath his confident, sarcastic, and egotistical facade that was difficult to see, at least outside of the sheer majority of fans it silently spread to.

And that's exactly what Technoblade does that I've never seen any other youtuber replicate. He was far from the only good person on Youtube, and he also wasn't the only good role model out there, but I'll be damned if he wasn't the most convincing one on the platform. For as long as he lives on in the actions of the millions he brought out the best in, Technoblade will never die. But now it's up to us, the community, to keep his memory alive and to uphold and spread the countless virtues he stood for. Let's make him proud o7

And thanks for everything, Alex.",@gravity_cow,UgyxPZBeOXOLk4_z6XN4AaABAg,0

Cowokie every one of your animatics , it just hits right in the heart, the sbi family dynamic , Philza+Mumza Love Story, the Ranboo Chronicle , the Wilbur DSMP story and now this , a tribute to a person so loved and respected by the community and youve done him the greatest justice.

"God, this is so fucking cool. I currently have tears running down my face and I can barely see my typing but it's okay. Techno meant so much to so many people, as shown by the way we continue to keep him alive through our art, fundraisers, songs, cosplays, and everything else. Seeing all the little references and jokes throughout was really cool, and when it got to the part where everyone was wearing the purple ribbons I started to cry. I fully lost it when all the artists were shown, because that's honestly where so much of his memory is kept alive by. 

I see so much fanart of him everyday, and every time it's bittersweet but I pray it never stops. I hope people continue to create and keep his memory strong. I hope future generations hear stories of Technoblade and know of the kind, compassionate, hilarious man he was. I hope more research is done for sarcoma so no more loved ones are lost to the terrible disease. But most of all I hope people keep smiling, and look to the sunsets and think of him.

"A poem by Helen Steiner Rice

There is no night without a dawning
No winter without a spring
And beyond the dark horizon
Our hearts will once more sing‚Ä¶
For those who leave us for a while
Have only gone away
Out of a restless, care worn world
Into a brighter day.

"Edits: Grammar/Spelling mistakes.

Technoblade was a living legend, but most importantly, a human. People seem to idolize him as some god, but I think it's more important to remember him as a fellow member of the human race- he was a person who had a huge fanbase and built an empire out of a silly block game, sure, but he also had a dog, a passion for minecraft, a loving family, and the determination to live.

During his life, he did everything he could to promote fundraisers for cancer. He tried so hard to make a statement, a change with the life he might not have much of. 
He was such a talented, honest, and straight-to-earth type of dude. He unknowingly united thousands upon thousands of fans, and built a community that respected and loved him.

Words cannot explain how much his content meant to me and others, and this tribute is obviously so meaningful. (Even though I haven't watched it yet, I'm SURE Cowokie will leave us absolutely speechless).



Finishing up this little rant of mine, I would love to end with the obvious..

Technoblade Never Dies.",@Golomaga,Ugw0n0HWyYhpr3Uihpl4AaABAg,5359
