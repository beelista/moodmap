"My first Smartphone was this iPhone, back in 2008. At that time, unfortunately, here in Brazil, the iPhone was unknown.  People were impressed when I showed them all the features and that beautiful, fluid navigation style.  There was nothing as beautiful, fast, versatile, practical, attractive, responsive, with a system as fluid and elegant as it.  Nothing similar to it back then.  I was very proud of myself for being one of the few Brazilians to have had an iPhone at that time. People frequently asked me where's the keyboard? where's the pen style? why is so big? 🤭

 Nowadays I use smartphones with Android (especially Samsung and Xiaomi) because unfortunately iPhones are not worth the absurd price they charge, and they are increasingly low quality and outdated.",@lequinho4,UgzuxUcpwmcDac7E4TZ4AaABAg,2

"I definitely remember that before iPhone, a cell phone was already a revolution from a home phone, but it was optional and more for business purpose. Then Apple made the cell phone a literal computer inside one’s pocket. Owning an iPhone at that time was a privilege of a rich person and was sort of a trend. Everyone started to use cell phones more, realizing how convenient and helpful they are, even the old school Nokias. Slowly, iPhones became less of a luxury but more of a common thing and people budget for them and buy used ones. You also started to see more people glueing to their phones more and more in public places. Nowadays, almost everyone use some sort of touch-screen phone that resembles iPhone, and many are addicted to its services. A whole new category of jobs are created such as mobile app developer, mobile banking, etc. Apple didn’t just introduce a new product. They changed the way the world views cell phones, and the way we live.",@vanessatrinh9793,UgwNFLRvrdz1QOZoNMp4AaABAg,13

"_’we invented the multitouch’_

Yeah right, except multitouch was invented 25 before the iPhone in 1982 by Nimish Mehta. In fact Apple invented hardly anything really. They just took what was already on the market and put in into one device. And Steve Jobs didn’t do any of that. He was just a rich guy who hired people to do it for him.
And boy did they fake things during this presentation. Look it up.

Whatever you say, phones sometimes makes us forgot how to live moment. For ex. concerts have no spirit now, all the people holding their phone and recording the moment instead of living the atmosphere. If you try to live the audience atmosphere,

There's no atmosphere because of this invention. Sorry steve jobs you accidently leaded to kill these moments, with starting mobile phone trend.

What is more ridiculous, while iPhone got stuck as a mobile phone with some features but limits as well, Android phones excelled and grew into pocket computers. 

I can connect Android phone into ANY PC and it becomes an external drive allowing me to simply move and copy all possible data. 
The iPhone on the other hand.. when you connect it to PC you still need to use iTines or iCloud to move data - but not all data, ONLY supported data files. 

It’s a pain to have 500 GB of storage and not being able to just simply and quickly use it to copy and move files. Being forced to pay for iCloud. Being forced to use prehistoric iTunes..

1984 – we introduced the Macintosh. It didn’t just change Apple. It changed the whole computer industry.
In 2001, we introduced the first iPod. And it didn’t just change the way we all listen to music, it changed the entire music industry.

Actually most got fired.

Most of the people who made this happen either got fired or quit from the stress and pressure put on them.

However, I feel that ever since Steve passed away, the iPhone has not changed much over the years, sure there have been technical upgrades, better cameras added each year, facial recognition and more, but nothing as ground breaking and game changing as this presentation. This was a quantum leap over everything that came before it. In 2024 apple is practically selling us the same phone over and over with different names for applications, minor upgrades and such, I feel if Steve were alive we’d already holographic phones by now, or phones that are senselessly integrated with our minds, he was truly an innovator and visionary",@DannyTheBarGod,UgxiNq_Lp9su6h9xosB4AaABAg,6

I'm now 14 going to be a 15 year old very soon and 9 years ago my passion for technology was born, my desire to be like steve (when i was a child) was born and the desire to create something as innovative and refined as the iphone was born with me.

"To all fanboys: Multi-Touch definitely was not invented by Apple, the iPhone was in 2007 the worst smartphone on the Market (In its Price range). No GPS, No Flash web browsing, no data transfer through Bluetooth, no playing multimedia outside iTunes, shitty and limited software, horrible sound quality, almost no apps, buggy as F... Low RAM, slow CPU, s, Stone Age display resolution, BS Camera, and let's not start with the battery.... at that time Nokia Symbian phones were light years ahead also WindowsMobile Phones were amazing. The I900 for example was an AMAZING phone!

The only smart move Apple did... announcing it in a strong Marketing Campaign to a non-tech crowd at the time when Mobile Data plans became affordable. Steve Jobs was not a technical Visionary, but a Marketing Brainwash master. Apple did not make Pro Audio gear, they just bought 2002 the company EMAGIC and forced them to release Logic only for Mac. Logic was an industry standard at that time, so people were forced to buy overpriced trash Macs to stay in Business.  In fact, in the 90s, Macs were so bad that Apple needed to borrow money from Bill Gates to keep the lights on. Only the iPod got them back to Life... Well, iPod... Yeah... my 80USD China MP3 Player had a way greater sound quality, it could actually play MP3 without any iTunes crap and I could use it as a USB drive at the same time...

I wonder what Apple would look like today if Steve Jobs was still alive. Would they still be releasing products every year that are almost exactly the same as their predecessors? Would they have released even more super revolutionary products? I feel like they tried to do that with the Apple Watch but it just never caught on like the iPhone did.

Still I am not convinced proper privacy for the masses can come from remote cloud services. Once you send your data away, even end to end encrypted, you are exposed to decryption at some point with quantum computers. Most of your data doesn't need such a grade of protection. But there is a simpler way.
Just sell hardware and don't try to profit from the users data. All software is open source and you don't pretend to gain money from it, your profit is hardware sales.

You sell a ""home cloud"" kit for less than a flagship mobile. It comprises of a private phone with a 100% open source OS you can trust. One main server node that runs and stores ""your cloud"" for you at home. And a dumb NAS only there for data redundancy and disaster recovery. All seamless with open source and e2e encryption from your phone. Your data never leaves your hardware unless you choose to do so.

"Раньше достаточно было одного Стива, который выходил в джинсах и водолазке, и показывал миру, то на что все остальные будут равняться... А теперь, куча на хер никому не понятных людей, с радужной хернёй, и тупыми историями, пытаются втюхать мне (каждый год) то что уже не меняется на протяжении порядка трёх-четырёх лет (если сравнивать 12 pro max и 14 pro max). Они добавляют какие-то эмодзи чуть ли не волосатых баб, они втюхивают мне дичь про какую-то инклюзивность, забывая о том что они техно-гигант, о том что они великая корпорация, а не сборище педиков из netflix с их повесточкой. И бл**ь Apple верните уже белых людей в рекламные заставки на ваших презентациях. 
Apple, где инновации ? Если вы не справляетесь, а это понятно ибо не возможно сейчас каждый год выпускать что-то революционное, то выпускайте новую модель раз в два, три года. Не надо позориться и каждый раз пытаться продать практически то же самое что и годом ранее. Хватит бегать с радужными флагами и долбиться в жопу, займитесь делом! Не позорьтесь. Стив на всё это смотрит и думает - что же за тупую херню Вы творите!
P.S. Apple я с вашими телефонами с 2008 года, я в какой-то момент перестал их менять каждый год, сейчас у меня 14 pro max, но перешел я на него не с 13-го а с 12-го, потому что не вижу большой разницы между аппаратами с разницей в год.

I remember watching this at the time and how groundbreaking it was but when the prices were revealed later I never for one minute thought I would pay that sort of money for a phone. A couple of years later I moved from a Motorola Razr to a 3G then a 5 then a 7plus (I think it was called) and I have just paid my last payment on my 12 Pro Max. It has become my one and only “treat” to myself every few years. I always pass my old phone to my wife who then gives it a second life so all in all we feel to get a decent return on the cost.

"Just after the iPod came out and just before this iPhone announcement, I had forgotten to roll over a 401k and the company sent me a check.  I was waiting for years for a phone that interfaced with my computer.  It wasn’t rocket science I put that money into Apple stock.  Needless to say, I could retire now, (although I never will).  Yeah, I am a horrible person when it comes to money and planning and so on… but looking at that iPod on my desk it was obvious…Well Netflix also took me higher.  The only stock I screwed up on, or maybe not was selling Tesla after the ceo made an idiotic tweet…that would be huge if I had not sold it.  I owned almost every Apple product and most Apple desktops.  In fact I bought the 165 c laptop I am pretty sure it was the first color laptop.  I would take it to school (I went back to a junior college to attempt getting a degree) the professors would look at me side eyed,  but never told me to put it away.  I was the only one in the entire school taking notes on a laptop.  Oh yeah, additionally I was the only one in coffee shops with a laptop.  And gen zers that was not that long ago…mid to late 90,s….I’m not bragging about the stock. When I was a kid we had a rotary phone that was on a party line.

All my friends started getting iPhones and I didn't believe the hype until I got one myself. I couldnt believe how fast it was and how smooth it was to use, it felt like a laptop in my pocket. I was so impressed. Nowadays I'm an Android guy, but not a single one of us no matter what we use cant say that the iPhone didnt change the mobile industry forever.

No app store, no way to even arrange the apps on the home screen, nothing.

"Steve Job's death went down in the history books as one of the most tragic and mysterious deaths ever. Everyone knew he was sick, but nobody knew what he died from - until now.

It turns out, Steve had been suffering from a rare disease called ligma - a strange condition that causes its victims to slowly turn into small, green lumps of goo.

At first, Steve thought it was just a cold. But as his condition worsened, his family and friends became increasingly concerned. Eventually the doctors diagnosed him with ligma and he only had a few months to live.

Realizing his time was short, Steve decided to make the best of it. He threw one last big party and celebrated life with all his loved ones. Every day he would make sure to find something to laugh or smile about despite his deteriorating health.

On the last day of his life, Steve gathered everyone around him and told them that no matter what happened",@Vorhut,UgwJJGDkNzJUjULSkgF4AaABAg,2

"I literally got in trouble for watching the entire presentation live while at work back in 2007 lol. Then preordered it for 500$. Waited 3hrs in line release day. Only to find out the speaker for calls was so low you couldn’t hear anyone unless you were in a quiet room, and that the camera was worse that the lg flip phone I had before. As in, HORRIBLE worse. Not even functional outside of daylight as there was no flash. Also, it only allowed one carrier. Which wasn’t prominent where I lived. So my calls that weren’t dropped were impossible to hear outside of my apartment. The camera didn’t work unless it was outdoors during the day. And almost none of my calls ever worked. Also, who remembers att “edge” data. So slow the browser was pointless. It would take up to 5-10 minutes to load 1 webpage while off Wi-Fi. I returned it in two weeks. Once the 3G came out. I was thrilled. Haven’t used anything but an iPhone since the 3G. Samsung is starting to temp me though. Apple needs to get with the future and move to foldable displays. I think if Jobs were still in charge they would have created the best foldable display long before other manufacturers put out their current flawed ones. If they weren’t flawed, I would have left the iPhone. Apple is not innovative in the league it was under Jobs.",@anthonyd507,UgwP0GL0JcomD1KAtrF4AaABAg,0

Okay but what is it? It’s a cell phone that combines the ability to make calls, hold music for MP3 player capabilities, and internet communication.

"This video is still one of the most historically significant and amazing moments of our lifetimes.

It'll be in the history books next to Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Alexander Graham Bell, and (more recently) Marc Andreessen and Tim Berners-Lee.  Even more than Apple's other amazing contributions, the iPhone put the internet in everyone's lives easily, permanently
I still think it's incredible how even such a forward looking human had no idea what was coming; he calls iPhone 3 things: an iPod, a phone, and an internet communications device, and Jobs and the whole crowd basically had no idea how important the internet was.  They just didn't get it.  He was so early that the world evolved around him and his predictions of what was important were completely wrong, even the great Jobs was looking backwards too much; you see him mentioning iTunes, the Macintosh, etc. as if anyone still uses or cares about those

And as for Jobs' presentations, he's the world's best presenter ever, much much more dynamic even than other great orators like Kennedy, Reagan, or Obama.  So simple, so organized, so many beautiful images, demos, he got almost all the jargon out, absolutely incredible.

The sheer amount of work by engineers, designers, marketers, just astounding.  And by Jobs personally, 30 years of his life up to this point went into computers, not to mention Wozniak launching Apple with the first 7 years, Jobs never would have become what he was without key collaborators",@Neonb88,Ugx-LJKSVVxfevx3JBR4AaABAg,4

"Hey guys I’ve got some really great news to share with you, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on a cross and resurrected on the third day so you may all have eternal life. If you believe and repent of your sins and put your faith and trust in Him as you would a parachute jumping off a plane at 25000 feet up in the air, He will give you eternal life in heaven as a free gift and I promise you, He will change your life forever as He did mine. He is the ONLY way to heaven and He loves you all. Please think deeply about this with urgency because this is your eternal life and soul, you don’t know when you could die, meaning you could die at any moment, so please consider this with all your heart. If anyone tells you that Jesus isn’t the only way, they are lying to you and they don’t care about your future. Thx for reading.",@teamhop,UgwIgW3NttqY3fasKnV4AaABAg,1

Respect from a lifelong android user. This was truly revolutionary. My distaste for Apple products grew from having a boatload of mp3 files and having to use iTunes to use them on my first and only apple device. I had a cheap SanDisk mp3 player at the time and all I had to do was drag and drop the files onto the file whereas to use the iPad touch I had to transfer all those files into iTunes and all organization was completely lost and 100% slower than the original process. The OG iPhone set the precedent for phones but once other companies caught up and have since surpassed apple I never wanted an apple product. Once again Apple with no doubt set the course for modern phones but I refuse to be held behind the apple-gate,@LennyCooley117,UgySAWLA6_hZFq53zEN4AaABAg,0

"This is a day I've been looking forward to for two and a half years. Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything. And apple has been, well first of all, one's very fortunate if you get to work on just one of these in your career. Apple's been very fortunate it's been able to introduce a few of these into the world.
1984, we introduced the macintosh. It didn't just change apple it changed the whole computer industry. In 2001, we introduced the first ipod and it didn't just it didn't just change the way we all listen to music, it changed the entire music industry. Well today, we're introducing three revolutionary products of this class.
The first one is a widescreen ipod with touch controls. The second is a revolutionary mobile phone and the third is a breakthrough internet communications device.
So three things; a widescreen ipod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone and a breakthrough internet communications device, an ipod a phone and an internet communicator.
An ipod, a phone, are you getting it?
These are not three separate devices. This is one device and we are calling it iPhone.
Today, today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone and here it is. No, actually here it is but we're going to leave it there for now.
So before we get into it, let me uh let me talk about a category of things; the most",@山口桜-e4x,UgyVFumVdBcWqMKuj154AaABAg,2

"The reason why I always come to this video is because there is so much to learn from it. The way Steve carried himself throughout the product launch along with carefully and smartly launching their biggest innovation by mentioning every little detail about their product which really grabbed and amazed the world at that time. He is not only smartly briefing his product innovation, but along with that, he is destroying the other smartphone companies of that time, especially Nokia and Blackberry. Undoubtedly, this made Nokia plummet in the stock and consumer market. Moreover, when you see this video you actually get to see how the world's perspective had been changed towards smartphones after this. No iPhone launch video can ever match the classiness of this one literally. 

Steve Jobs was a smart man and was way ahead of his time and competitors. Even after so many years, we could see that the iPhone is still a niche mobile phone in the market and people are literally giving the fortune to buy the iPhone (this is true in some parts of the world though).

"two years after Steve introduced the world to the first iPhone, Apple did another amazing thing by making touch screens accessible to blind people, by incorporating the VoiceOver screen reader into iOS. Initially, it was only available on the iPhone 3GS. It is now available on all Apple products including the iPhone and iPad and has been for many years. I am blind myself and never thought I would ever be able to use a touch screen device. However, I am able to use my iPhone without any help from a sighted person which is amazing given that it is operated by tapping on a flat featureless piece of Glass. After the 3GS was made accessible, other companies took the technology that Apple Used to make Touch screens accessible and incorporated their own version of it into their own products. Not only did Apple make their products accessible, they helped make the smart phone and tablet market accessible to people like me. Thanks to Apple and their reputation, other companies followed suit in making their products accessible which means blind and visually impaired people like me have a choice of what products we use. Before the iPhone, if a blind person wanted to use a mobile phone, we had to buy the phone and then buy a separate piece of software which cost a lot of money. We would then have to pay someone to install that software onto the phone before we could use it. After we had bought the software and had it installed, we had usually ended up having to pay two or three times the amount of money that the phone was being sold for in the first place. 
Thanks to the iPhone being accessible, we can walk into a shop like anyone else and buy a phone and set it up independently.

We no longer have to pay extra for the privilege of being able to use our mobile phones. 

 Smartphones have also replaced certain pieces of assistive technology for blind people (Like reading machines),which were usually very expensive to buy. A lot of these pieces of technology have now been replaced by smart phone apps.

Why am I still watching this in 2024? It has somehow become an annual tradition for me to revisit this video every year alongside the release of a new era of iPhone. It's like a nostalgic journey that I can't resist.

I am forever grateful to Steve Jobs for his revolutionary contributions. He was truly the Thomas Edison of Technology, in my humble opinion. The way he introduced the world to the iPod, the phone, and the internet communicator was nothing short of remarkable.

And let's not forget that iconic phrase repeated three times: ""An iPod, a phone, an internet communicator."" It still brings a smile to my face. It's like a little inside joke for Apple enthusiasts, reminding us of the simplicity and power of these devices.

So here I am, watching this demo once again, laughing at myself for still finding joy in it. But hey, it's all part of the fun and excitement surrounding the evolution of iPhones.

"It's really interesting if you know a little backstory behind this presentation. The iPhone software was still incredibly glitchy even up to this point and they weren't 100% sure it would go off without a hitch like it actually did. They found out that there were certain tasks that were not stable if you performed them in one way and then stable if you perform them in a different order. For example, if you opened up app A and then app B, the phone would crash but if you opened up app B and then A, it was stable. They spent months conducting trial and error tests that would allow them to showcase all of the features that they wanted to show off as well as run a minimal risk of the phone crashing so they had everything coordinated in that sense. 

Almost nobody on the iPhone team got any sleep the night before and once a specific teams section was done in the presentation, that team was busy backstage taking shots. Also, Steve Jobs was incredibly mean to everybody on the iPhone team and while they respected his vision, nobody actually liked him because of just how much of a jerk he was. I remember reading one engineer saying that a meeting in which Steve did not scream at or belittle somebody in that meeting was the exception and not the rule.",@FIDEL_CASHFLOW_,UgymmTjS6LFat1hw7op4AaABAg,0

"With the necessary apologies for iPhone fans, I must make the following clarifications: 

iPhone A1203 AKA iPhone 2G or iPhone 1 It was officially announced in 8-12 January 2007 at Macworld by Steve Jobs,
and was released in the United States in 29 June 2007.

The LG KE850 AKA LG Prada It was first announced on 12 December 2006 and was created in collaboration with
Italian luxury designer Prada. It was made official in a press release on 18 January 2007 and sales started in 7 May 2007.

So LG Prada It is the FIRST Smartphone in The World with a touchscreen display and with many more options than the iPhone
which does not support personalization like themes, or ringtones (It was embarrassing, it had ONLY ONE TONE FOR CALL!)
and does NOT have a Memory Card slot.
He also had NO Radio and could not film video, he only took pictures.
And in this section LG Prada was superior with a FM Radio, with game support (has four pre-installed games
Halloween Fever, Photo Puzzle, Virus, Pipe) and a camera with Schneider-Kreuznach optics lenses
with LED Flash which it could film video CIF at 30 frame/second! Also has a microSD Memory Card slot wich support up to 2 GB.
Steve Jobs said about the iPhone is 3in1 (Phone, iPad and Communicator).
So LG Prada in other words, it is not only 3in1 but is 5in1 (even more), because it also has a Video Camcorder and a Game Console
in addition to the Phone, Multimedia Player and Internet Communicator (Browser/E-mail).
All this really makes it The First Smartphone in The World !
Who else would accept today that the smartphone does not film or does not have support for games and can be customized
with wallpapers, ringtones, in a word themes and more than that without have a memory card slot ?!
Well LG Prada could do all this since then, before the iPhone !",@maricicapuica9385,UgwNgWXCyE5SCfSNHch4AaABAg,1

The only company that  could catch up building Smartphone similar that could compete with Apple IPhone is the company Apple use to build their phones.  Samsung (colossal mistake or snart).  Plus you had Apple let 1 of the maybe 6 Companies that could create a Software good enough to compete with them in their doors.  Which was Google (just a colossal mistake).

If Apple builded the IPhone themselves and also didn't let Google look at their software, but instead made a Search Engine to destroy Google.  Then no one would've caught up for the next 10 years after they premiere the IPhone.  Every Smart Phone would've been a joke in comparison until like 2017 making Apple worth about 3 times as much as they are now.

While Apple devices and software don't appeal to me in the slightest, it would be foolish to deny the influence this one device has had on our every day lives, and the Motorola I am typing this on is just one of many derivatives of this original iPhone.

Every single smart phone on the market today has a touchscreen, phone, and media capabilities all in one device with a unified  app ecosystem. Every single device has practically all the features that this device has, and any that don't are perceived as a joke.

I kind of wish Apple wasn't so popular today. It feels like without the drive to snatch up marketshare, innovation has stagnated. We don't know what we don't know: what innovations are out there still waiting for us, and what have we missed?",@CertifiedGShep,UgxeoD72VGmcLBjzMMN4AaABAg,1

"In the early 1990s I worked briefly at a house where 8 mentally retarded adults lived, to help them get dressed, eat, etc.. One of them had like 12 pairs of the same jeans and 12 of the same red polo shirt. He would not wear anything else. If you tried to give him a clean shirt, he'd know it wasn't the one he had worn the previous day and would take it off, wanting to wear the same shirt every day. We resolved this by washing his jeans and shirt every night. Steve Jobs reminds me of that poor mentally challenged man. When you're a ""genius"" your brain has to give up some real estate to fit in all those ""genius ideas"" and what is discarded are usually compassion, decency and honesty. I see this in Steve Jobs and in many of the billionaire  ""geniuses"" that are worshipped by the hundreds of millions of useful idiots.

Steve had the gift to see the future, he started with what technology could give him to work, now phones are super powerful, they probably would replace the entire computing brains by just simply connect to a screen or to a pair of glasses to see everything bigger, the phone is in my opinion, the most robust tech device ever created and it will continue to improve to unknown places, it destroyed almost all devices out there, cameras, mp3, palms, phones, gsm dongles, and will continue to grow.

But, he also gives us blessings, a beautiful love that is everlasting, and abundant life! He gives us eternal life in Heaven and is always our protector. As long as we stay with him and follow him, he promises to give these things to those that accept Jesus as Lord and Savior and walk in his righteousness. The best part, he saves us from our sins and shows us true love and joy! All for free! No money, no paperwork, no signature. Just follow him and do his will, which he will teach you, and he will save you, if you just trust in Christ to be saved and follow him. God may not do everything that you expect in this life alone, but if you are one of his, You can expect to be very fulfilled. Even in Heaven!

Arguably It would've been better for society If this product never happened , but I think someone else would've made something similar anyway and other phones would've caught up to most of It's features , and people still would've became social media zombies. The addiction to mobile and online was already there before this launched In 2007. We take anything good and use It the wrong way for bad and mess It all up.

"To the person reading this, you are precious and valuable even if you don't feel like it. Jesus loves you ❤ He paid a price on the cross for you. He rose on the third day and defeated death. He took the punishment in our place. He did this out of his inconceivable love for us. He can revive your situation no matter how messed up it is. Don't end your life at any point. There is hope in Jesus. He is able to deliver you from sins. He is able to take away your depression, loneliness and suicidal thoughts etc., He is able to heal your sickness and disease. You just have to humble yourself and call out to him ""wholeheartedly"" and he will answer you. He set me free from porn addiction and masturbation in 2018 which I struggled with for almost 10 years. I was close to death three times and he saved me. He changed my lustful heart. He can transform your life if you let him. You just have to repent from your sins and transfer your trust from yourself to Jesus. He will give you the peace which surpasses all understanding, even in the midst of trials and tribulations. Fear won't grip you anymore because you will receive the assurance of eternal life when you believe in Jesus. He is the only way to heaven. He paid our fine by shedding his sinless blood for our sins. Our good works cannot get us to heaven. Those are like a bribe to the judge of the universe. This is a very serious thing. We never know when our last minute on earth is. It could be any second, hour or day from now and if we don't have forgiveness for our sins, we will end up in Hell. We cannot take our money, riches or fame with us when we die. We have to give an account of our life to God. We only have chance till we are alive on this earth. Please think about this. Don't let pride stop you from knowing the truth. I was prideful before and rebelled against the living God and forsook the truth just because I didn't want to lose. Humble yourself and call on to Jesus from wherever you are and ask him ""sincerely"" if all these things are true and he will reveal it to you. He will open your heart to the truth. You can experience him personally if you try it. You won't lose anything. Jesus is coming soon. If we have not repented and turned to him, we will end up in hell. This is not a religion. This is a relationship with God. I am telling all this because I care for you. Even though I don't know you personally, I know that your soul is extremely precious to God. The reason I am posting it here is because we never know when our last moments are. It could be anytime from now and I don't want you to end up in hell. Jesus is the only who can save you from your sins and grant you everlasting life, after life on earth ends. May Jesus reveal himself to you. God bless you.

You just have to humble yourself and call out to him ""wholeheartedly"" and he will answer you. He set me free from porn addiction and masturbation in 2018 which I struggled with for almost 10 years. I was close to death three times and he saved me. He changed my lustful heart. He can transform your life if you let him. You just have to repent from your sins and transfer your trust from yourself to Jesus. He will give you the peace which surpasses all understanding, even in the midst of trials and tribulations. Fear won't grip you anymore because you will receive the assurance of eternal life when you believe in Jesus. He is the only way to heaven. He paid our fine by shedding his sinless blood for our sins. Our good works cannot get us to heaven. Those are like a bribe to the judge of the universe. This is a very serious thing. We never know when our last minute on earth is. It could be any second, hour or day from now and if we don't have forgiveness for our sins, we will end up in Hell. We cannot take our money, riches or fame with us when we die. We have to give an account of our life to God. We only have chance till we are alive on this earth. Please think about this. Don't let pride stop you from knowing the truth. I was prideful before and rebelled against the living God and forsook the truth just because I didn't want to lose. Humble yourself and call on to Jesus from wherever you are and ask him ""sincerely"" if all these things are true. He will reveal it to you. He will open your heart to the truth. You can experience him personally. Try it. You won't lose anything. He is coming soon. If we have not repented and turned to him, we will end up in hell. I am writing all this because I care for you. Even though I don't know you, I know that your soul is extremely precious to God. May Jesus reveal himself to you. God bless you.",@darsanprakash27,UgwYiPHP9t_BnlpEum54AaABAg,0

"I know this doesn't have anything to do with the video, but I would like to share these questions and this message with as many people as possible.
 
1. What do you think happens to someone after they die?
2. Do you think there is an afterlife? 
3. If heaven exists, how do you get there? 
4. Would you be good enough to get into heaven?
 
Here are a few questions to see if you are a good person: 
 
1. How many lies have you told in your whole life? 
2. Have you ever stolen? 
3. Have you ever used God's name in vain?
4. Jesus said that ""whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart"" (Matthew 5:28). Have you ever looked with lust? 
5. If you have broken any of these commandments, would you be innocent or guilty on Judgment Day? 
6. Would you go to Heaven or Hell?
 
The Bible says that ""all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone"" (Revelation 21:8) and ""Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people — none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God"" (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). So, if you are guilty of any of the ten commandments, then you are in trouble when Judgment Day comes! Do you know what God did for guilty sinners so that we wouldn't have to go to Hell? 
 
2,000 years ago, God became a human being, Jesus of Nazareth, who suffered and died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead on the third day, defeating death. The punishment that we deserve for breaking God's law, Jesus took in our place. He paid the fine that we could never pay so that God can legally set us free by forgiving our sins. He is just, by punishing evil through Jesus’ death on the cross, while being rich in mercy towards us. 
 
What you have to do is repent, or confess and forsake your sins, and trust alone in Jesus Christ. Don't trust your own goodness, because, as Jesus said, “No one is good — except God alone” (Mark 10:18). Trust alone in the savior. The moment you do that, God will forgive every sin you have ever committed and grant you eternal life, and He will give you a new heart with new desires, so that you will love to do what is right. You will be born again. But you must repent and trust in Jesus. 
 
When are you going to do that?

if you are looking to do videos and have some sort of microphone and hdmi capture setup already, an a5100 is an amazing camera. there is usually one with a non-functioning flash on ebay for $250-$275 that you can grab(you will never use the flash when doing videos) and the performance is amazing IMO. very crisp and stupid cheap.",@andrewwilkinson7832,UgwqKzbCAgqJvr5P13J4AaABAg,0

"Who else here remembers how the original iPhone was complete shit due to it being on Edge network?? It took 3G and google maps to make this thing truly revolutionary. iPhone sold 6 million units. That's 6 out of 330 million people in the USA that had an iPhone. It was more of a curiosity or an expensive ""show and tell"" than a revolution. The iPhone 3G was ""twice as fast, half the price,"" as they'd worked out subsidized deals with the phone companies by that time, and 3G network speed made Google maps functional. It sold over 20 million units, and it was game on.

"Revolutionary the iPhone was indeed. Still, I’m glad he wasn’t around to dictate how the iPhone is to be used roughly 5 years after that. The 5S probably is the biggest release since the original iPhone yet and many great things on it would not have been there under Steve Jobs. Brilliant tho Mr. Jobs have been, he did not want the iPhone to be used for quite a few things.

It’s not like some folks wrote before me, that he didn’t want 3rd party apps. That’s a steaming pile of bull, because the very first iPhone was barely powerful enough to do what it did. There simply was no headroom left and shortly after that there was an iPhone with an App Store. Still, the first iPhones were weak. For a quite a few years the iPhone wasn’t to be used for too sophisticated things. The iPhone 5S was different. For the things done at that time, it had some sophisticated headroom and this made it (and other smartphones at that time) much More versatile. And think about why there were signature crowds, hundreds of people waiting in line for a new iPhone. It was because every new iPhone was capable of more things, every iPhone changed significantly enough to warrant a new purchase. In 2014, Nobody in their right mind would have used the very first iPhone anymore. Nowadays the Smartphones are so powerful, that most people Never begin to make use of all their power. I used to be an enthusiast, getting a new iPhone every two years, but the iPhone X, that I’m using now does all I’d ever want a smartphone to do - streaming music and video, taking photos good enough for social networks and editing them, recording and editing sophisticated videos, being a capable home office on the go, playing games, being my every-remote, communication central, notepad, extended memory and much more - and still has so much headroom left, that there is no need to buy a new iPhone yet. I had the battery replaced the other day, but that’s about it.

So No, I don’t mean things like that. For instance, Steve Jobs would not have approved for those giant displays found on smartphones nowadays tho that’s part of their success as a everything device. I’d not even think about edit a video on a display as small as 3.5 inches, but Steve wanted his smartphone to be small. And this would have limited the iPhones capabilities severely.

He was working for Adobe. when he came back he was so happy with the id card he got and he became fan of apple since. he told us that this is gonna change of everything. even though sony ericssion and other companies where working on same project , apple didnt wanna make the same mistake what they did years ago with Microsoft, wait too long to release.  he was explaining how you can scroll the screen , he was so surprised cause all this was like a movie for him.  also oldies like me would remember how we had windows touch screen monitors like cursor will follow your finger. thats what they had back then in his office.",@theAzaab,UgzmLwBLpJGy9-uZSaZ4AaABAg,11

"My media teacher mr burak was in the behind the scenes of this event a story... How the story goes is that mr burak worked at this event took place. He had just recently been promoted to this position. His mentor and him worked on the presentation, and the setup of this event. Surprisingly the event took a negative turn with the screen not turning on and glitching out just a few moments before the video that you are watching right now. Steve Jobs was furious and he fired mr buraks mentor which seems odd because Steve never worked there. But the man left with all of his office supplies, pictures, and info. Burak was laughing at this because he thought there was no way that Steve could fire someone who he never had meet in his life. Steve saw him laughing and did not like that one bit because of his product that would never be seen HE FIRED BURAK AS WELL! Burak laughed thinking there was no way. But his boss came out and told him to pack his work and get out. But Burak was the better man and as his way out of the building he found one cable an orange one that was in plugged probably because of the rush of this event. And sure enough the screen turned on and Steve yelled in happiness. So Burak walked back to Steve Jobs saying “Hi mr Steve Jobs, I just wanted to say that I fixed your shit.” And burak just walked out laughing never thinking that Steve Jobs would become so wildly popular. And all of that success goes back to one man and that Burak.",@zombie8157,UgyTbCIlDNDGQRl_5pp4AaABAg,0

"Omg apple is snake oil salesman. They piggy back off others and make any change they do to it calling it the best when they are far behind most the time. They say they are for customers yet they charge arm and leg for it all and get less. Do history first touch screen phone was in 1992 wasnt true smart phone but was over a decade before touch first touch screen computer 1965 so the technology was already there they just put it to a comupter. Also mp3 was 1997 for first one not apple yet they say they are best yet they don't let you add memory why so they can make you buy bigger one after you buy a small one yet others have let you add memory to me that means others care about customers. Also did and maybe still today doesn't apple use samsung lg  and sharp screens? Not thier own so they can't say they have best screens cuz they are on other devices already? And cameras are Sony so they don't have best camera again? And for for those who wanna tell me other wise go right ahead all companies do this yes but apple is the biggest ones to say they always are the best they aren't they took all best of others to make it. How about I make a car using 10 different cars to make one using best of all them in one and say I have best fuel yet Toyota has one that gets 8 more miles to gallon yet I say mine is still better cuz I'm using this youd all call me out saying your scam and I would be cuz I would be, also ill say I have finally done park assist and mine is so much better far better than rest cuz the car beeps when its done and you need that it only adds 3000 to the car. I have added 12v plug in with custom plug in that only uses our cords that run 30 for plugs cuz I can. Every other company for smart phones use same cords to make it easy for everyone, adding memory as I said is big deal and helps save customers money and they can always add so they can add movies songs and pics so u don't need to use data if your limited or going to be offline. Face unlock didn't work and was bad but that was old tech when they added wireless charge was old tech they added. Alot off apps on their store you pay for yet android theybare free I can use samsang and say I like razor better I can go to them and my apps work or go to Motorola,  lg, any android and works. Other companies have cheap phone that are almost as good as Apple flag ship to wear standard users will never know difference between them or aleast enough to say the double price is worth it. Apple should just start to get with times and use same cords allow android apps on there's or let android users download thier private apps. Also I seen videos apple charged hundreds to get a phone in red that was it no other difference just red and charged fortune to get it in red. So you want snake oil salesman all companies do it yes but apple makes the biggest and most bs.",@timothyzdroik890,Ugyuq1NqAFZHogNrh414AaABAg,0

I loved it so much and Mac OSX was incredible. My Dad saw how much I wanted this iphone, not just because it was cool, but because I kept telling him how much of a revolutionary device it was  going to be and even tried to Convince my dad to invest in Apple before the launch of the iPhone when the stock price was about $3 (It has split since), even begging him to use my college fund d money lol, it is currently $116.97 or roughly 39 x more. He's still kicking himself for not listening. He Told me if I paid the $175 to cancel my contract with Verizon as I had a Moto Razr at the time, and got an A+ (94% and above) on every Test and as my grades in every class he'd get me one for Christmas. I did it and had one of the best Christmas Mornings ever.

"Be a Billionaire in RUVOL

I have invented a Board Game [still unpublished] that is guaranteed to be far more challenging and exciting to play than CHESS.  I called it “RUVOL.”  

Over time, Ruvol will surpass chess as the “Number One Board Game in the World.” 

Why am I so sure about this?  Because I am an avid chess player myself.  I found the moves in chess to be so repetitive and predictable that any clever player could easily master each and every move to a point that they can even play against opponents blindfolded.  It is exactly for this very reason that I was encouraged to invent a game that cannot be mastered where every game is always a new challenge and exciting to play.

The “Global Income Potential” of Ruvol is just mind-boggling!  

In my Google search, I found there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  I could readily assume every chess player in the world would be tempted to buy a set of Ruvol to see how it compares to chess.  At an average profit of just ten dollars per set, the “Global Income Potential” for the owner is a whopping US$8 billion.

"Before this keynote, there were soooooo many wish lists for Apple to produce a wide-screen iPod. We never knew if it would ever happen or not. There were also rumors swirling that Apple was going to create another phone, be everyone remembered the debacle that was the Rokr. Plus, nobody thought that Apple — a company that never actually made a phone — could ever actually compete against the Nokias, Blackberry and Palms of the world.

So when he said they were going to introduce a wide-screen iPod *AND* a phone, that's why people went nuts! *The rumors were true!* Even down to the 'iPhone' name!

But no one anticipated that this product would *literally* change the phone and internet industries forever. Jobs' bold statement of 'reinventing the phone' was prescient and true :) I think this presentation was pretty much a 'One more thing' after a long presentation of Apple TV and some other stuff lol.

"We take all this technology for granted now. It's easy to sit here a decade or more later and criticise, but this changed our world. Completely. Technologically, culturally, and socially. It opened the world to new platforms: social media at our hands. Where would Android be without it too? 
Personally, I've never used Apple - but, I don't believe I would be using Android it wasn't for Apple, Jobs, and their vision at the time. 
Now they're just a pack of greedy technocrats picking at the last bits of meat on their rotting product. Android's not far behind. Every one of their updates is more pointless, data sapping, and more space hungry than the last. We, like our Apple friends, get nothing for this comparatively; but they get our data: all our information. Apple set the template for data collection through their system, and Android like a good little puppy dog - followed. The updates aren't for our benefit - it's for theirs. To make it easier, more comprehensive, and total: their data collection. Knowledge is power, and power translates to wealth.

For hours and hours a day... every day.... for the rest of their lives.... Slaves! The internet in the palm of your hand, wherever you go, whatever you're doing. Beckoning, calling to you like the sirens in Greek mythology... You won't resist... Games, shopping, porn, YouTube, social networking and messaging... You'll never turn it off. You'll become addicts.

At the end, everyone presented, and while most people had odd gimmicks in theirs, one keyboard just worked. Long story short, he used a form of AI in his keyboard.

Our hemp oil is produced through the mechanical pressure of the seeds, with cold method without the use of solvents and chemical agents and not rectified.

The colour can vary from light green to deep green, the aroma is not very pronounced and the flavour is intense, reminiscent of dried fruit.

The daily use of hemp oil, recommended by the WHO (about 2/5 teaspoons per day) among the healthiest natural products, rich in omega 3 - 6 - 9, vitamins and polyphenols helps to strengthen the immune system and prevent and combat diseases of our body.

An example is the rapid lowering of LDL cholesterol levels (the bad one), thus reducing the risk of thrombosis, and it is also possible to see lowering of triglyceride levels in the blood.

"Saw this in ""live"" should I say, and it's insane to see how visionary Steve Jobs was. Beyond the good communication and superlatives, yes this changed the industry, forever. From hardware to use of phones itself. Apple saw things so far at the time, that is hard to imagine. Remember how slow and gimmicky it was to use a smartphone at the time. It was a major breakthrough in absolutely all aspects. And it did better in all those aspects. I used to have all the iPhone models since 3gs to the 6s, and just wait for the new best thing. But truly, I wonder what comes next for the industry, especiallywithout people who takes risk like this. This is historical.

"NOT the first to combine all 3 items... just good marketing. If you look up the Nokia Communicator (many versions that literally crapped all over every phone on the market) and it came out years before Apple said the word 'iPhone '... apart from no touch screen it had MP3 capability, a web browser for HTML and WAP plus it could call and even fax! it was on GSM and EDGE (2.5G for people who don't know what EDGE is) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_9210_Communicator ... The next PDA phone to have the functionality of a phone (as we know it today with camera and media/web browsing) from what I can tell was the Palm treo 700w and the HTC 3600/3600i, the HTC I owned back in Dec 2006 with HSDPA (unlike the iPhone which was still stuck on EDGE and didnt have an app store to begin with, the app store may be the actual milestone they really created that changed the smartphone market) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_P3600#/media/File:HTC_P3600.JPG , lastly one of the first colour touch screen phones (not a PDA as such) that could do all the above (not inc an application store), announced in 2016, the LG Prada: https://www.bing.com/search?q=lg+prada+release+date&cvid=5b589f5e2b5e4b54b00d95973cffe019&FORM=ANAB01&PC=ACTS",@3XPOSINGTHETRUTH,UgygxZRurv_urzqcGhh4AaABAg,0

In 2009 a iPhone came to my house courtesy of my uncle! Who got it from someone who drank to much. He wanted 200$ cash I was what is this I was perplexed? Gave him 100$ I said it could be broken it didn’t turn on. Next day went to Rodgers bought the charge cores 50$ went home and it charged. And was locked. Any who weeks later paid him is other 100 and a bonus 50. But couldn’t use it. But my wife found iPhone unlocker.com paid 80$ downloaded a file and a pineapple was over the logo at the start and was cydia not Siri for internet. So I went to Rodgers and said could I get my phone on a plan the workers said what phone I showed them. They took it in the back and was smiling and laughing came back and said 200$ deposit and 130 a month im ok. They scan’d  a  paper and I’m hooked up working iPhone in 2009. A month later I tried to download an app from iTunes and my phone was locked. Oopsey so I called Rodgers for help they said what you don’t iPhone with us I hung right away lol! Bought another 80$ iPhone unlocked.com stayed away from iTunes after that. But I had spoof app. American app and you could call anyone with any number record the call and change your voice. That was 2009 can’t imagine in 2020 what you can do with this system. I was meant for iPhone the creator wanted me to have it,@blainepotskin1884,Ugw00nZgB2bTY5kwVVB4AaABAg,0

Extra : I got the iPhone on day one in Florida the apple geniuses clapped when we left the store and eveything. B day gift from my dad 6 months in advance . The iPhone was sitting on my table in Costa Rica with no connectivity for like 8 months because it only worked with the stupid AT&T ..
Word got around and I had people coming into my house just so they could take pictures of the iPhone . I unlocked it in December 2007 with a thing called TURBOSIM from Russia. Sold it for $1500 to a buissnes man . I was 16 then . bought a 8G one with that money kept 1k for me and unlocked it again . Sold it again .. that trick worked a couple of times.
