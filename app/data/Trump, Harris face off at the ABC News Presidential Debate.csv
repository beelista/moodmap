No matter how much you help or want to help the people, by allowing a multitude of people in the United States of America to come, people who don't listen to our  moral standards, you affect their livelihood  which affects their businesses. By continuing allowing us to go into Major debts and raising our infrastructure, we the people begin to struggle to pay for our basic necessities.

I cant help but wonder if he hasnt read it specifically so he can claim plausible deniability, but then again, we've all heard at one point or another about how much Donald Trump hates to read anything. It has also been said that he even refused to read his daily national security reports when he was President of the United States.

Jesus' time here on earth was misunderstood and he was crucified so everyone was baffled and astonished but His purpose was served and salvation is at hand. So even if you do not end up in office, God has a mighty purpose for you, I see it in your fight, and God will win. Stay strong, you are a mighty tool for God.

"* Everyone misunderstands president Trump and his analogies about dogs and cats in comparison, he’s looking at how people act and he’s comparing them metaphorically to that of dogs and cats. They need to look at the bigger picture behind what he tries to say. His statement tries to aim at that specific idea about people as he’s trying to explain a general group of society. Let me explain clearly about what he try to tell us, we all know dogs and cats are very loyal to their home and their owners. The meaning here is deeply imbedded in what we know about  Kamala Harris. She isn’t  loyal to this country and he knows that this country is very DRAMATIC, so he’s giving clues and subtle notions about his idea he trying to get across. He wants us to try and figure out what’s wrong and what’s right ourselves without us having to be lead like a lost dog in the middle of the woods.  Kamala Harris’s campaigns seems to be solely focused on the power of being money hungry.  She wants to gain money, but she doesn’t have the correct prowess and mindset to lead our nation to the correct path. Trump passed a test, a test of word and wits. Regardless of the same events happening over and over again, Trump tries to change the mistakes that happened. This time, he’s rewarded for the hardships he went through. He’s going to win this election, I’m sure of it. He has what it takes to be on top. He’ll come back, smarter, stronger, and surge with more pride than ever before. If he holds true to his words, he’ll become an unbreakable force that will hopefully nurture this world for the better, never for the worse. powerful unbreakable. Sharp forces  formed who he is as a person. Like angels descending from the heavens, people that follow what’s right always walking side by side, hand in hand together. With each bit of prosperity and hope, we’ll venture forward with him if we try to protect him along the way. This is an age to bring back the balance we missed and yearned for all of these years. The world is a fleeting once in a life time event, all the mistakes, joys, and problems that we make as a community, grow us stronger. If there was a day of Armageddon, all we need is our hope and faith to keep ourselves going, to greater gods we believe in. Judgement cascades upon areas of this world, it shakes the very core and heart of what we know, yet some parts of the world uphold our struggles in hopes for something better. No human can stop the wild fires that spread, and the luminescent waters that flow over land. This could be a sign for judgement, it’s a sign for change, for a better golden age. For everyone that holds on with their last bit of strength. What shakes the holds and grasps of places like China, will also show us what it’s like to build from the very bottom up. We shouldn’t ever be greedy in terms of power, but we should have enough power to uphold justice. There’s always more to come, the unexpected is always in front but we need to make sure we stay on the same path together.  What we miss is the unity of each other, we need to learn to love one another once again, although fights may never dissolve, we need to try and unify with one another. We need to keep what we have with us and make it prosper. If the past and present flourishes with each step we take, future generations will also thrive. Sociologically, we need to understand everyone has a different religion, if we accept everyone as we are, we may have a universal connection with one another and end some of the feuds we fueled. We all grow and make mistakes, but keep trailblazing forward with a brighter future in mind.

"How does a person win a debate when she evaded questions, IN EFFECT didn't debate?, The fact that she avoided questions proves SHE LOST on those questions because she had no good answers. Hiding in the basement worked for Biden., she's hiding too. Also, lying (knowingly) as she did about Trump is also a failure and a debate loss? General Trump won the war because he understands how to win. The debate is to win more voters, the undecided. First, Kamalas' fakeness shined through, so the undecided can't trust her.  She lost them. But now Trumps brilliance in marketing won the day. When he mentions the immigrants eating pets, it was an incredible statement. very attention grabbing, and despite the ""moderators"" (you know, the Kamala protectors /Trump attackers) attempts to laugh and devalue, Trump continued pushing the astounding claim, with specific details!!! Why? Because Trump understands the young voters. The reason why the polls show Kamala losing ground is that no one trusts the mainstream media anymore, especially these  moderators. This generation and others will LOOK THIS UP! and TRUMP KNOWS THIS!, What do you think happened? They found out that this WAS TRUE!!!. These migrants are stealing and eating cats , dogs, ducks and HORSES!!!. AND the young voters who find this out will SHARE this with other young voters, and so on, and so on. Have you seen the Animal saving/Trump memes? They're hilarious! Animal rights activists pay attention! You can't get better marketing, especially pets that the young people love, and they will talk and discuss. This will go viral on a personal level. Illegal  Immigration is a hot topic and Kamala failed America on this and everyone knows it, but this pushes the needle way high. This is why Kamala is now trying to introduce a bill to silence news that she would deem ""misinformation"" , like they did on the last election (Thank GOD for Elon Musk). Too late Kamala, ""the cat's out of the bag!"" (the migrant animal abduction bag).
So you treasonous/ treacherous ""mainstream media"", you're done. The viewers are doing their own fact checking, and why? Because people can smell feces when you speak. General Trump wins again!

"People often vote based on which candidate’s personality they like more, rather than focusing on their policies. Despite the past four years under the Democrats and the Biden/Harris administration, which many consider to have been horrific for the U.S. in numerous ways, it seems most people will continue to ignore the facts and vote Democrat. The mass media appears to be a key factor in swaying or steering public opinion. Studies show that Donald Trump receives 90% negative media coverage, while Kamala Harris gets 90% positive.
Under Democratic leadership, there has been a dramatic rise in crime, restrictions on free speech, harassment and imprisonment of political adversaries and even parents, trillions of dollars added to the national debt, and the promotion of the LGBTQ agenda. Illegal immigration seems to be prioritized over the needs of Americans, with blatant discrimination against Whites, open borders, and massive third-world immigration. There’s also the threat of never-ending foreign wars, including the possibility of a third world war with Russia. Transgender ideology is being imposed on children, government agencies are weaponized against citizens, conservatives face mass censorship, housing has become unaffordable, corporations are buying up single-family homes, and inflation is at record highs.
The list of concerns seems endless, yet many Americans remain unaware or in denial of these facts. When asked which candidate they prefer, many simply say, ""I hate Trump."" It becomes difficult to support a particular candidate when all you hear and read in the media are negative comments about them. Over time, after being exposed to incessant negativity, it’s tempting to follow the mainstream narrative and claim the moral high ground by denouncing that candidate. In essence, the mass media—with its ability to control the airwaves and shape public opinion—is a key factor in determining the outcome of elections.",@Spmr900,UgxMsaLmuzR8OEmR6354AaABAg,1

"Trump again shows he's not a professional politician, he's a business guy who got into the game late in life, he's never going to be a polished debater or speaker.   Harris was smooth and prepared, Trump was his usual odd non sequiturs, stumbles, repeating himself trying to gather his thoughts etc...  Only reason he spanked Biden was because Biden is senile, against a youngster pro politician he didn't do as well.   What is strange is how unprepared he is for obvious attacks Harris was going to launch, doesn't he have people prepping him with appropriate answers to those attacks?  We knew she was going to bring up his legal problems and call him a convicted criminal but Trump had no response when she did.   The response he should have had is simple, it would go like this:

""I've angered powerful people who don't like the fact that I truly represent the interests of the middle class voters in this country so they weaponized the justice system against me.  That's how politics works and if you don't understand that Kamala, then you don't understand politics"".

That's the ideal answer, it's concise, reinforces the idea that he is a populist candidate and turns the question around on Kamala.   How could he or his advisors not be prepared with an answer like that?  He's running for President for chrissakes.  Sometimes I think he has operatives working for the other side working for him.",@jeremiahjohnson1513,UgwPxz7eCyTQfkiD90x4AaABAg,1

"VII. It was very ridiculous to hear from VP Kamala that Pr Trump is weak on foreign policy.
     The PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH  has always beared all the fruits expected, helping the U.S. to be safe. Trump has kept and implemented this doctrine during his presidency.
     VIII. And VP Kamala can't lecture anyone on foreign policy. Not only they've given big money to Iran in order to end his nuclear program but also as said by Pr Trump, Pr Biden has allowed the Nordstream 1 and 2, giving the opportunity to Russia to earn big money. Furthermore, even when the war in Ukraine started, the energy crisis has helped Russia earn enough money as the sanctions at the beginning did not target the oil. Morever, Iran has used the money we gave to them to modernize their army and help Russia in Ukraine. 
     IX. One of the best asset of the USA has always been its ability of talking to our ennemies in order to win their hearts and transform into our friends. 
    There's nothing wrong to talk to Putin and other dictators. This is called Personal Diplomacy. 
    X. However, we also need to have a clear understanding of their project. The Global South is currently engaged into Post-West Era agenda that is associated for some to the Post-Americanism Era agenda. 
    XI. We can say that VP Kamala hates Israel. However, and in reality, she loves Israel only when it can become a socialist, marxist and progressist country.

"III. As usual, the liberals always know how to blame others but refuse to be accountable of their own failures.
   3.1. The very bad demand policies of Pr Obama from 2009-2017 made it easier for him to have a very bad presidency mainly at the economic level. 
   Instead of recognizing that he did fail big, not only he did manipulate data in order to have a very good economic performance but also, Hilary Clinton during the presidential debate in 2016 did not hesitate to blame the 2007-2009 Financial crisis for being accountable for the failure of Obama.
   We all remember her: "" Remember where we were"".
   Today again, Kamala Harris is repeating the same narrative. 
    Of course, there's no doubt that the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has eroded the best asset of Pr Trump: the booming economy the U.S. has experienced for the three first years of his presidency.
   However, all the experts agreed that from 2017 to February 2020, the very good supply agenda mainly driven by the Energy and Manufacturing Renaissance have boosted the U.S. economy. Full-employment was back in the country. Some states were experiencing unemployment rate under 4% to 3%.

He never use his finger to blaming people by colors. It sounds like she is blaming a person doesn't to have a further relationship with her and mark him a lable to call him a racist. I think Harris need to go to see the psychologist. She need help. She is imagine anyone is going to hurt her and look down upon her but actually people never do that. Poor people. Dont run the president or you will cry every day because you will think the whole world was hurting you. Really recommend pay attention on your own healthy. Really concern about your mental healthy.

I wish Trump luck, and I will vote for him but I no longer have any faith the system isn't rigged like it obviously is in other countries. Republicans don't truly embrace Trump because he's an outsider to the schemes public servants participate in to become millionaires while in office at jobs that don't pay what it takes to live the lifestyle they live. If Trump wins great but at the end of the day some other career politician will eventually be in power and back to business as usual with all the theater of one side vs the other all while next to nothing actually gets done. I still wouldn't want to live anywhere else but it's so different once you see things they kept you blind to for so long. A cackling hyena she is but she has what it takes to be a politician where lying is the most valuable skill.

So it would be good if YouTube starts flagging this comments as an opinion and maybe we can have a rating how ultra right or left the opinion is. If it’s news, then there are fact and those are not alternative. You can have an opinion on facts but this is an opinion not a fact. Maybe change the name: fox opinion. And this is a fact.

"6.1.2. The second contribution of the Cluster is to help develop more EXPORT-ORIENTED ACTIVITIES AND JOBS that are high paid jobs and upstream activities (high-added value).
     That won't be the case with the support and plan of VP Kamala. 
     We've seen with Pr Obama already who has created many low-paid jobs in the public administration with his Obama Reinvestment Act. 
     The Kamala's plan could lead to the same outcome.
    VII. It's also relevant to be strategic when it comes to the Middle Class and the Middle Class Economy in the U.S. Even Pr Obama who has created this concept in 2014 has realized that it was almost impossible to be achieved. In fact, 80% of the global middle class will be located in the global south in two decades. 
    The share of the middle class in the US is declining and this could be be accelerated in the near future.

         Of course, doing so can boost their productivity and profitability and help them to reimburse the debt.
        However, the adoption of AI is also associated with the increase of Productivity-Pay Gap that in turn tends to widen the Wage inequalities that she wants to fight.",@jamesmichaelwalker683,UgxCr8czxJNnvti4ut54AaABAg,0

      Doing so can increase the COST OF BORROWING MONEY  for the SMEs and low-wage households. This is what we call Eviction Effects on the Financial Market.
    Of course, the SMEs that will be helped by her plan will be better off in the short-term and middle-term. However, it won't be the case for those that won't be helped.

    Since then, it's becoming relevant to help them in order to build an Inclusive, Diverse and Prosperous America.
   5.2. And yes! one of the major challenge that the SMEs is facing in the U.S. is their inability to get access to financial resource.
     Since then, it's relevant to help them get access to the financial resource.
   5.3. However, the proposal of VP Kamala is not the good solution. Even worse, it'll hurt the SMEs throughout three mechanisms and factors:

"Do Late-Term Abortions Really Happen in the U.S.?

Yes. The definition of a late-term abortion is imprecise – and shifting. The gestational age at which an unborn child can survive outside the womb, with medical support, is decreasing, with instances of survival occurring at 22 weeks gestation or slightly earlier. While most states report a gestational age range at which abortions are performed, several jurisdictions that are hospitable to late-term abortions do not collect or publish such data nor do they transmit it to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Nonetheless, reports by the CDC suggest that roughly 1% of all U.S. abortions are carried out at or after 21 weeks of gestation – as many as 10,000 late-term abortions per year.",@howdysteele2428,Ugz54NKv7WC92caq1Rl4AaABAg,1

In the past, Trump claimed he would reduce prices by increasing US oil production, but he has not explained just why oil producers would increase oil production beyond a level for which there is a demand. They won't, because it is not in their economic interests to supply more oil than they can sell or produce oil at a level that would reduce their profits. That's the way capitalism works. Moreover, last night Trump had to admit that US oil production is actually higher than when he left office. So just what is Trump going to do to reduce prices?

2)  How do you respond to the fact that the Biden administration kept the Trump tariffs?
3)  Regarding illegal immigration, why did the Biden administration wait until 6 months before the election to act (on illegal immigration) and would you have acted differently than President Biden?

"The debate last night between Trump and Harris seemed to highlight strong contrasts between the candidates. Supporters of Trump might argue that he showed confidence and adherence to his principles. On the other hand, Harris's supporters might view her performance as well-prepared and focused. Debates often evoke strong reactions, and how one interprets them can depend greatly on their political views and expectations. 
One thing to be sure is that the debate format was unfairly structured against Trump, the moderators were clearly biased, making it a three-on-one debate. 
Watch it yourself to determine the intelligence of each candidate and more importantly to determine which candidate truly cares for the country. 

In my opinion, to make the USA ""great again,"" we need to truly focus on several key areas. First, boosting the economy is crucial, so we should create more jobs, drive innovation, and ensure fair trade practices. Addressing inflation is also critical; controlling rising prices will help maintain economic stability and ensure that everyday life remains affordable for all. Investing in education and skills training will help prepare people for the future workforce. We also need to make healthcare more accessible and affordable while strengthening public health. Updating our infrastructure and promoting green energy will help us move forward while taking care of the environment. Keeping the country safe with strong defense and robust cybersecurity is essential. We need transparent, accountable government and bipartisan cooperation to tackle major issues effectively. Addressing income inequality and supporting small businesses will help create a fairer society. Encouraging civic engagement and building community ties will foster unity, and we must address systemic issues to ensure justice and inclusivity for everyone. Finally but not the least important key, smart immigration policies and workforce development will support long-term stability. All of this requires a team effort from the government, businesses, and communities to make a real difference.
We should not focus on anything else!",@ngangracenguyen5227,UgyQ1jDlcSUozogB-454AaABAg,0

How many times did he started his reaction to her claims by saying ""that's a lie"" that it had become really obvious that what she was a LIAR. 

Kamala Harris had practiced very well how to tell lies with a straight face knowing that what she was accusing him are deleted,  exaggerated or extrapolated, selectively edited accounts of factual events. Anything that modified the truth is a lie.

That Donald Trump was upset by the barrage of accusations and lies thrown to him by Kamala and by the obvious bias of the moderators only show that he is not a fake person. He is a fighter. He will react.

That Kamala smooth talks, promises and playing on people's emotions show that she is role playing to get people's votes. No one should forget that she lied the whole time about Biden in good health until it was exposed during the first debate that he is definitely in advanced mental decline. When Biden was ousted that was when she exudes JOY. 😆 😂",@nidayap3441,Ugya71sY1r4RGb0J_d54AaABAg,0

Democrats are complaining about the immigrants situation now.

"If I remember vividly Trump does not read his proposal or bills pass through office. That scares me. Also Kamala concerns me. 



I remember my school haul in high school 2011~ 2015Walmart you could find 10. Cent to 15. Cent spiral note books . 50 cents for glue and can buy school supplies under 5 bucks and last through years. I even gave my brother my .25 cents of dozen pencils that were basic. Horde in my stash from my high school years to my younger brother now 16.


One is being outright negligent. I believe both Trump and Harris are Marxist. Takes one to know one. 

If I remember working in grocery store since 2016 before Trump and Joe Biden took office. In Arizona, Gad prices used to be under 2 dollars. Simple herds like spring onions and cilantros were under 50 cents. One time 2018 in Fry’s store they had sale for eggs for .50 cents for dozen. You could buy 3 dozen eggs under 4 dollars. Groceries were manageable. 


Keep in mind in Obama’s presidency he prevented an outbreak from spreading nationwide and stop recession. I can remember in middle school when I was 11. 2008 talking about housing crisis. That was widely spoken about Great Recession.

Than COVID hit , 2020. That is when Trump presidency in office Jan 20 2017~Jan 20 2021. During both presidents, food has skyrocketed. Joe Biden didn’t aid do anything better for economy either.

Minimum wage in Arizona 8.05 in 2016. My 1st job was so much affordable.

Now we’re are here 2024 eggs have double. Eggs I use to consider expensive for 3 to 5 dollars is the new normal. For non organic or organic eggs. Milk you buy for dollar a gallon from store brand is now 3 dollars or more. It is not even great quality milk. 

I can find better quality clothing than food kind disturbs me. 

Honestly, I would like hear other people’s input and experience. I don’t have faith in this campaign in either candidate if both fail to deliver real proposal for the people and not their pockets going deeper.

It is sad to see veterans homeless and rise homeless gone over the roof. Where is humanitarian?For the American people.

People still remember African American Martyr 'George Floyd'. Trump is a racist who favors white people, and you want to support him? The economy crashed during the pandemic; what happens if such a situation occurs again? On the other hand Small businesses of all races flourished under a Democratic government. Democrats gave opportunity to all. They never favours racial/ immigration discrimination which Republicans used as propaganda for votes furthermore Republicans only favors a white-centric agenda in the name of patriotism.

It was founded for the freedom of religion and who each individual was and will become! By over throwing RoeVWade, they have forced their religious beliefs on all people! No one has that right! There is a thing called the separation of church and state! I'm torn because I can see where both of them would do a good job at times, and also where each would fail. I do agree on the catastrophe of the oil field.  As a former employee of that business. When the democrats did all they did, when Biden signed those papers. Yes yall felt it at the pump, and the cost of motor oil. But we who were working there, had our yearly income, literally cut in half! And groceries yes I agree with the vice president.  Now single, just two weeks ago went to Walmart. With a dedicated list for meals, no junk food. Single, and my groceries cost 287.00! Absolutely insane. My heart goes our to single family homes and all those struggling to make it. There is a delicate balance here to decide on. Yes Biden has failed this nation horribly!! Dosnt mean Kamala will.

"I’ll be voting for Trump, not because I’m a fan of Trumps, but because of his teaming up with the likes of RFK Jr and Tulsi Gabbard, among others that are working together across party lines to bring freedom and peace to our country again.  But I will say that Trump needs to start listening to RFK Jr and speak about the topics actually negatively affecting American lives. It’s nonsense to spend so much time talking about the immigration/crime problem. Get elected, close the border. Done.  But why is no one talking about the chronic disease epidemic impacting our children? Why does everyone seem blind to this? Why is 1/38 children autistic today, when in the 50s-60s, it was 1/1000? Why do so many kids have life threatening allergies? Why do we allow our foods to be poisoned with addictive ingredients, hormone disruptors and forever chemicals, banned in ALL of Europe but somehow allowed in the USA?  THESE are the realities that are crippling American families.  It’s the hidden tax that we don’t realize we are paying and it’s costing us more than these pointless wars. We are paying trillions to have the increased resources to care for and educate these kids and nobody is talking about getting to the root of this issue.  We need people in the White House that are actually capable of solving the problem. I don’t have faith that the Harris team would do this problem any justice. They would make it so that voices speaking out against injustice in this country continue to be silenced, cancelled and censored, and that terrifies me.  The Democratic Party (of which I used to identify) has lost its way.  And while I don’t love Trump, I do wholeheartedly trust RFK Jr and many others who will be working alongside Trump.

"None of the US parties, institution, departments are trustable. Both Democratic and Republican parties are backed by genocidal billionaires. Joe Biden’s top donor is Haim Saban. Donald Trump’s top donor is Sheldon Adelson. Haim Saban is a Bollywood billionaire with ISISraeli roots. He said “ I am a one issue guy and my issue is ISISrael” 
While Sheldon Adelson is dead, his ISISraeli wife has taken over the foundation. Sheldon Adelson said he regretted joining the US military and wished he could fought for ISISraeli army. He said he had hoped to see a nuclear bomb dropped on Iran. 
Haim Saban and Sheldon Adelson’s foundation work together for through something called IAC (IAC), which supplements AIPAC. 
You may have seen that both Republican and Democrats representatives went o threaten ICC if ICC issues any decision against ISISrael. They clearly warned that US will ban ICC staffs. You may have also seen Trump is criticizing on Genobiden too much during his election campaign but he carefully said nothing on genocide and ISISrael, because policy of all American parties are same they want to strengthen ISISrael while eliminating and banning all opponents of ISISrael whether they are a country or freedom fighter organizations.",@chemophile14,Ugzs8V7yS-IAT6guC8p4AaABAg,0

"I don't understand why Kamala accuses Trump of only talking about himself when 70% of the questions were asking Trump about himself. They are making him defend himself about his personal problems and then Kamala trashes him for him talking about himself. She and the media successfully helped themselves avoid answering tough questions. To the Democrats credit, I do believe they used Trump against himself and We all know Trump loves talking about himself so they appeared to do well by obfuscating and sideskirting the real issues. Look how they both answered the questions about the war. Trump actually said what he'd do when Kamala just says the war needs to end and that's it. Trump can do better and not fall into their trap. But Kamala will just keep need to have no plan for anything. We need to do better as a country my people. We need to actually be able to vote for the candidates.

2 Senior Leaders who cheat on their wives with junior rank Soldiers. 

2  Feminist women who  just hate Strong men.

As of January 2021
Trump Administration Accomplishments
Unprecedented Economic Boom

Before the China Virus invaded our shores, we built the world’s most prosperous economy.

America gained 7 million new jobs – more than three times government experts’ projections.
Middle-Class family income increased nearly $6,000 – more than five times the gains during the entire previous administration.
The unemployment rate reached 3.5 percent, the lowest in a half-century.
Achieved 40 months in a row with more job openings than job-hirings.
More Americans reported being employed than ever before – nearly 160 million.
Jobless claims hit a nearly 50-year low.
The number of people claiming unemployment insurance as a share of the population hit its lowest on record.
Incomes rose in every single metro area in the United States for the first time in nearly 3 decades.
Delivered a future of greater promise and opportunity for citizens of all backgrounds.

Unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, veterans, individuals with disabilities, and those without a high school diploma all reached record lows.
Unemployment for women hit its lowest rate in nearly 70 years.
Lifted nearly 7 million people off of food stamps.
Poverty rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans reached record lows.
Income inequality fell for two straight years, and by the largest amount in over a decade.
The bottom 50 percent of American households saw a 40 percent increase in net worth.
Wages rose fastest for low-income and blue collar workers – a 16 percent pay increase.
African American homeownership increased from 41.7 percent to 46.4 percent.
Brought jobs, factories, and industries back to the USA.

Created more than 1.2 million manufacturing and construction jobs.
Put in place policies to bring back supply chains from overseas.
Small business optimism broke a 35-year old record in 2018.
Hit record stock market numbers and record 401ks.

The DOW closed above 20,000 for the first time in 2017 and topped 30,000 in 2020.
The S&P 500 and NASDAQ have repeatedly notched record highs.
Rebuilding and investing in rural America.

Signed an Executive Order on Modernizing the Regulatory Framework for Agricultural Biotechnology Products, which is bringing innovative new technologies to market in American farming and agriculture.
Strengthened America’s rural economy by investing over $1.3 billion through the Agriculture Department’s ReConnect Program to bring high-speed broadband infrastructure to rural America.
Achieved a record-setting economic comeback by rejecting blanket lockdowns.

An October 2020 Gallup survey found 56 percent of Americans said they were better off during a pandemic than four years prior.
During the third quarter of 2020, the economy grew at a rate of 33.1 percent – the most rapid GDP growth ever recorded.
Since coronavirus lockdowns ended, the economy has added back over 12 million jobs, more than half the jobs lost.
Jobs have been recovered 23 times faster than the previous administration’s recovery.
Unemployment fell to 6.7 percent in December, from a pandemic peak of 14.7 percent in April – beating expectations of well over 10 percent unemployment through the end of 2020.
Under the previous administration, it took 49 months for the unemployment rate to fall from 10 percent to under 7 percent compared to just 3 months for the Trump Administration.
Since April, the Hispanic unemployment rate has fallen by 9.6 percent, Asian-American unemployment by 8.6 percent, and Black American unemployment by 6.8 percent.
80 percent of small businesses are now open, up from just 53 percent in April.
Small business confidence hit a new high.
Homebuilder confidence reached an all-time high, and home sales hit their highest reading since December 2006.
Manufacturing optimism nearly doubled.
Household net worth rose $7.4 trillion in Q2 2020 to $112 trillion, an all-time high.
Home prices hit an all-time record high.
The United States rejected crippling lockdowns that crush the economy and inflict countless public health harms and instead safely reopened its economy.
Business confidence is higher in America than in any other G7 or European Union country.

When we talk about third-trimester abortions, these are done with the consent of obviously the mother, with the consent of the physicians, more than one physician, by the way,"" Northam said.

So in this particular example, if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.

"She's a black Marxist.  She used to be Indian, the videos are out there.  Then she magically became an African American.  To also correct Harris, Trump didn't spread birther lies about Obama, he simply did what millions of Americans did, and demanded actual proof that Obama was born in Hawaii.  In reference to that, the Hawaii birth certificate is a fake.  Barrack Hussein Obama was born in an American embassy in Kenya, Africa.  He cites a stature in the constitution that says that American embassies are technically American soil.
To Ms Harris, please, for the love of god, stop proposing more and more tax credits and welfare.  All that does is increase the national debt.  Kamala Harris is  Marxist.  She's never denied it.

"Trump fears the recession, he will do anything to avoid it as it will be a bad rep on him. Kamala and team think they could fight recession, if it is here they think they will be able to handle it.
Trump +1, Kamala 0.


Trump is unclear about abortion ban. He seems torn between his promoted pro-life vs actual Women Rights and their health. Kamala and team are strong here with their support for pro-choice movement. They feel women should be empowered to make right choice for them and their family.
Trump 0, Kamala +1.

Both Trump and Kamala are opposing Immigration. However Trump seems strongly against immigration whereas Kamala is we will handle immigration somehow. It affects both Citizens and Immigrants these policies and lawmakers on either side are greatly impacting negatively with no long term solution on immigration.
Trump -1, Kamala -1.


In the Israel-Hamas war, Kamala is pro-humanitarian. Trump is pro-Israel. He believes he could pressure in the middle-east and keep postponing a resolution on the conflict. However till date Biden Harris Govt has bought in no solution for this war because they probably don't have one.
Trump +1, Kamala 0


On Russia-Ukraine war, the Biden-Kamala Govt fueled the war by favoring NATO and providing support to Ukraine Govt directly by financial aides and Military Support. However like Israel-Hamas, they seem to be pro-humanitarian here. Trump supports legacy leadership in Russia and does not want to disturb that dynamic as Russia is Nuclear capable. However nothing here has deferred the war but support Human Lives.

To be fair to Trump the next debate should be on Fox News since this debate obviously was against Trump they did not push back one time and ask her follow-up set all on any of the questions that she never answered and with Trump they pushed back on him about 12 or 13 times and some of these situations were completely unfair to him so if they moderate the next debate on Fox News then we can see how she does when she's in a different environment not quite so friendly to her and biased in her favor but she probably would never agree to this even though Trump could go into the most dangerous neck of the woods and talk openly and give interviews she never will agree to any of that and that's not a sign of a true leader who is supposed to lead the entire free world?,@robertmarszalek1978,UgxHSZ0ze0OEcdYv4yh4AaABAg,0

I'm trying to stay impartial here however this debate is my final straw with her. I've seen several interviews with her and it seems that her views seem to change when it suits her. She makes absolutely no sense . 
And the last thing... Like the song says Mrs Harris ,"" What have you done for me lately?"" Nada, nothing ,not a damned thing other than the administration that YOU'RE apart of making sure prices of everything and anything sky rocket beyond affordable for the average American person. Yet you don't seem to be worried about that issue at all.  You don't seem to care that immigrants are given luxury hand outs and yet we have homeless vets , single parent families who can't get help with housing and so much more. Bottom line is she is out of touch with the needs of the American people.All she wants is to win...and she'll say and do anything to do so.. lol but we all knew this from her political career this far , So yes Madam VP...

The establishment “swamp” politicians WANT the Ukrainian war to continue to go on and on. Note that Harris did NOT meet with Putin. This Ukrainian conflict is another Vietnam and has NOTHING to do with U.S. national interests. PutIn’s stated goal is to make Ukraine neutral and not part of NATO. You cannot blame Putin for that. NATO seemed to be up to no good in Ukraine. It seems like the oligarchs of the EU want to force Russia to give up the BRICS alliance and fall in line with the petrodollar system. We do know that ethnic Russians were being attacked in the Donbas (Eastern Ukraine). They were actually Nazis doing the attacking. How do we square this with what is fair and right in the world?

You want to act Holier Than Thou, tell us something of substance. This is your time to prove yourself. Trump can talk about any topic with known fact, conviction, realistic statistics. It’s called the power of knowledge, credibility, responsibility!!! Pres Trump has it hands down and he is power, strength and bravery! Where is your’s VP Harris?

The democrats are grasping and blaming Trump for their deliberate sabotage on America and the American people.  Remember the emails Clinton sent on her personal account. Biden had classified documents. Remember bengazzi. Remember the lies about Trump and Russia why haven't the others been held accountable. TRUMP DIDN'T LOSE 2020 WE ALL KNOW THAT.

"The big issue listening to pop stars is the fact that they're literally blown up by the media and dont have first-hand experience with the legitimate issues since they already have so much money at their fingertips. When they assist, they dont know the persons true experience, only what the person has told the celebrity. An example for the democrats case are how the media can make up lies going to stuff like the supposed stimulus-checks that are truly just rumors/lies. This is just an example of how many lies can be spread across the media. But the truth lies in the numbers, and the crimes have truly gone up exponentially, they just arent reporting every single incident because most of them are just repetitive small crimes such as theft in retail, that truly adds up so much so that we have hundreds of stores closing up and chains going bankrupt. They blame the corporates, but its because the value of the dollar has sunk so much so that people just dont wanna work and retailers cant afford what employees are asking for. Are you gonna work hard and pay loads of money for a college degree just to get a starting wage of $20-25/hr, or would you rather just suck it up and do a retail job(cashier) that pays the same amount. With retail, a good 50% of their employees are typically high school or college students just trying to make an extra buck on the side. When you have stuff like student loan forgiveness, your killing off the need for students to get the extra buck to try and avoid interest. The fact is, if you forcibly increase wages, itll just cause a chain reaction in causing the dollar to sink in value.",@austing9060,UgzDQX5WXyGdouOZlN54AaABAg,0

"She's gonna give people money IF they vote for her, then babbles about how we can't afford to do the same old thing with Trump again lol. First, nobody pays taxes, it's the biggest lie that people overwhelming believe. Everyone gets money from someone else to send to the government, and this repeats across anyone who has any business with each other. Taxation IS inflation, and nothing else. The government is mandating we create money out of thin air by forcing everyone to inflate the value of their time in production only the government is not a participant to said production. When the government taxes, that's money that was never yours, when the government lets you keep it AFTER adjusting you gross to produce the net you need, then you do exactly what the government does, you spend it only you spend it faster and indiscriminately. Cutting taxes actually cause a more rapid and intense form of inflation because the people inject that money into the economy much faster than the government. The truth is, taxation is inflation, and just like Trump said, it's a nation buster but on the flip side, tax cuts have to be in place long enough for the inflationary effect they produce to subside. As for tariffs, Bill Clinton imposed a 100% import duty on luxury cars from Japan, the response from the Japanese was to get around those duties by assembling their cars in the U.S., which is how Toyota ended up being assembled in the U.S. So tariffs at least provide negotiating power, taxes simply make everything we buy and produce more expensive. And the Democrats are completely lost on this. When they tax the wealthy to help the poor, they are actually reducing the purchasing power of the poor, because the rich like everyone else are not really ""paying"" taxes, they are getting that money from everyone they do business with and those people pass that cost on to everyone that does business with them. And this repeats until eventually all the people the poor rely on for product are charging them more for this swirl inflationary effect. As we move down the quintiles of income from top to bottom the elasticity in income mobility decreases, which means that the wealthiest adjust their income immediately, the middle adjust not long after that and the poor have to wait last to gain the leverage to adjust their income in response to the inflationary effect of government policy and all government policy creates inflation as well because it relies on taxation which it inject into the economy and that money has no correlation time in production. Money only gets value from one thing and one thing only, time in production, people's time because nothing has value until people put their time into it. So it's the lesser of two evils, we can only hope that Trump tax cuts will stand long enough to overcome the inflationary effect of handing people money directly that they were never supposed to have direct access to.",@whipivy,UgztNaMxspOWerGqBJ54AaABAg,0

"During the Trump administration, there were three government shutdowns:

January 20–22, 2018: A brief 3-day shutdown occurred when Congress failed to reach a deal over immigration, particularly regarding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

February 9, 2018: This was a brief shutdown lasting only a few hours overnight. It was caused by a delay in passing a bipartisan budget deal.

December 22, 2018 – January 25, 2019: This was the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, lasting 35 days. It was primarily due to a dispute over funding for President Trump's proposed border wall with Mexico.

These shutdowns were the result of disagreements between Congress and the president over key issues such as immigration and budgetary matters.",@maynunal,Ugww3Bs0naLhd3mSLb14AaABAg,0

That did nothing for inflation,  right .
Not to mention flirting with a nuclear  war.

How does a retired General endorse VP Harris when she illigally presided  a vote in the Senate by denying some citizens  representation in Government by acting with representives voted out of office and bribed Senator's to vote for thier $80 billion candyland bill by attaching more candyland bills. The sneaky Senate majority leader did that a Republican and done so to deny the newly elected Congress to act and they claim they bring the bacon home, to bad it was illigally done.

Only a corrupt court would hold citizens in bondage to representatives voted out of office. 

They should lose thier military retirement by lying to the public. about the VP.

"THE GOSPEL'S GOOD WORD

1. You Will Know Them by Their Fruits — “Beware of false prophets, who come to you sheepishly, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits.""

2. Father's Good Fruit — ""But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.""

3. American Idols — “Those who cling to worthless idols turn away from God’s love for them.""

""Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods.""

""All who make idols are nothing, and the things they treasure are worthless. Those who would speak up for them are blind; they are ignorant, to their own shame.""

""People who do that will be put to shame; such craftsmen are only human. Let them all come together and take their stand; they will be brought down to terror and shame.""

4. Father Never Knew You — “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name...and do many mighty works in your name?’ And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness. Anyone who says, 'I know him,' but isn’t obeying his commands is a liar — the truth is not in him.""

ON GOSPEL AUTHORITY: REPENT IDOL WORSHIPPERS — THE TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM! GOD HASN'T SPARED TRUMP AS AN ENDORSEMENT — HE HAS SHOWN GRACE, MERCY & LOVE because that's the nature of a GOOD FATHER! A good father is also JUST, and the season of accountability ✝️ JUSTICE is upon you FALSE MEN. 

Shared with a divine love, and for the edification for the Body of Christ—true followers of ""The Way,"" not worshippers of lawless men, guns, flags, borders nor religion—by the blood & in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ.

"It's so wild that this debate is even happening. Say what you want about Harris, but at least she's not a traitor who tried to steal an election, who sat and watched the capitol building get broken into, threatening the lives of our elected officials; who signed the monumentally redacted Doha agreement, who made America look like a joke to every country in the world---besides our enemies, fancy that---and so much more. If Thomas Jefferson were to spring to life and see Trump and Trump's America, he'd unalive himself on the spot.
I don't blame people for electing him the first time, I disagreed with it, but I understood it, but if you can look at all he has done and still think he should be in office, let alone the most powerful person on the planet, you are redacted. Or maybe your ideological brain root is so deep and so pervasive that you completely lack the judgement to do what's right, regardless your party and/or allegiances.
Lastly, if you're in the military, or a veteran, just look up how Mad dog Mattis feels about this bellicose buffoon. He's one of the greatest generals of all time; one of the the best Americans of all time; an honorable man, a decent man, a person who cares more about this country than a person like Trump could ever imagine.",@HellaSayHella,Ugxrqec30QIqyzkxo0Z4AaABAg,0

Print more money will that help inflation. Trump has already did his ideas and they worked like no other president. She was given one job fix the border. Never been there.

"Very disappointed in Trump. I highly doubt he did any significant debate prep. I’m also questioning, if it was a good strategy to participate in the ABC debate. Trump rambles too much, and had many great opportunities to provide significant facts. While he indicates millions of people have come across the border, he needed to personalize it for voters. Think of the innocent young US women who were either out, jogging, or out and about, and were murdered. Trump would answer a question however, his answer was not even related to the question. He tended to recycle the same four or five topics over and over again. He seemed very light on policy and spent most of the time bragging about how everyone thinks he’s great. He needs to understand that this is a national audience, and he must sway undecided voters. Please no mistake, I don’t think Harris  offered any specifics. However, she did come across as more composed, less bitter, and of course, she did go after Trump on several occasions. Just disappointed that Trump had difficulty staying focused and staying on point when answering questions. I think we’re Trump really suffered in the debate was highlighting migrants eating dogs and Victor Orban references. Really, he looked absolutely foolish. A BIG D  for those who prepared him for the debate. I don’t think Trump helped himself in this debate. Be mindful he is being considerably outspent and one debate could have negative impacts for Trump. Guaranteed, Kamala Harris will not agree to a second debate. She barely speaks to the press. Trump blew it on his closing message to America. Continued to rehash the same old stuff and did not offer any optimism. Sorry folks, he just appeared incoherent  and unfocused. His campaign, agreeing to an ABC debate was absolutely terrible. In fairness, the totality of the questions, favored Harris, and litigated Trump’s past.

I’m voting trump because he has past experience and our country was stable and I was able to live better. Things weren’t to expensive. The world wasn’t as war. The border was closed and California was safer under trump. A 49ers player was shot smh. Never heard of that happening here until this year.

On the other hand, her strategy was better than Trump's, she placed him on the defensive, she was well prepped for the debate. She, in my opinion, never gave any real reason for anyone to believe that she is accomplished, capable, or moderate. Trump is right, she will say anything to get elected, and then fall back on her radical Communist agenda and beliefs if she gets the Presidency. Trump sounded flat, muddled, and so deep in the weeds that I did not believe he came off as defending himself well.

He wore me out in less than 5 minutes. Ironically, he was fairly good at his job 20 years ago. But he has been repeating himself over and over and over and over and over, introducing atrocities that he introduced countless times previously. I cannot take this droning pattern that he employs both on his radio show and on Fox. Versus Colms he was a master.

I understand it’s an important topic, but so is everything else. This debate was totally slanted in Harris’ favor which did give Trump a disadvantage. But the main problem is that Trump came off as way too hotheaded, where Kamala appeared calm (even though she was definitely nervous at the beginning). Trump needs to stop using so much hyperbole in order to win.  If he had just pointed out that Harris didn’t answer the questions multiple times, this debate would debate would have been a whole lot more different. I hope he can pull it together in time for the next debate. But even if he doesn’t, there’s no way I’m voting for Kamala. Trump 2024 ❤🤍💙",@londiumweekly,Ugwjs2I3bKEExrBLtod4AaABAg,0

And at the end, Trump closed the deal with a simple question.  If she is going to do all these wonderful things, why hasn't she done any of them during the 3.5 years she has been vice president?

And when he suggested waking up Joe at 4pm and getting started on these things, I almost lost it.  The moderators asked her about all of her flip flops.  And she avoided answering the question entirely.  Because, as Trump correctly stated, she was lying.  She is a far left liberal who is trying to look moderate for a general election.
